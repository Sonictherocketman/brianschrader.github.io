According to Apple, dragging the folder over to the new drive in the Finder should work, but about 100GB into the transfer it throws up an error, \"Presentation could not be opened,\" and quits. After some investigation, I discovered that \"Presentation\" is the name of an old Keynote file I have backed up. I have no idea why the Finder needs to open that presentation, but apparently it does.</p>\n<p>Last night I tried sudoing a cp. About 20 mins in, cp got stuck and even after letting it go all night, it never got unstuck. Tonight I'm trying again, this time with rsync, after a suggestion from Stack Overflow. If this doesn't work, I don't know what else to try.</p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/time-machine-transfer-trouble","location":"/archive/time-machine-transfer-trouble/","published":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 ","title":"Time Machine Transfer Trouble","slug":"time-machine-transfer-trouble","article-number":80}
