Seeing as it's December 30th though, I doubt I'll make my <a href=\"http://brianschrader.com/archive/microblogger-status-updates-and-more/\">end of the year deadline</a>. Today, I added quite a bit of documentation and <a href=\"https://github.com/Sonictherocketman/Microblogger/wiki\">even a wiki</a> to the project! I've also clarified the <a href=\"https://github.com/Sonictherocketman/Microblogger/issues\">issues</a> quite a bit, so if you're interested in helping out with the project, but aren't sure what you can help with, or if you want to read about how the project works go <a href=\"https://github.com/Sonictherocketman/Microblogger/\">check it out</a>!</p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/microblogger-wiki-and-issues-are-live","location":"/archive/microblogger-wiki-and-issues-are-live/","published":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 ","title":"Microblogger Wiki and Issues are Live!","slug":"microblogger-wiki-and-issues-are-live","article-number":81}
