Apple is, in my layman's opinion, too\ndependent on their competitor for parts that are essential for its business\n(namely its A-series processors). There's been a lot of talk in the community\nabout how beneficial it would be for Apple and Intel if they were to cooperate,\nand Matt points out a great starting point for their negotiatons. It'll be very\ninteresting to see if anything is announced at WWDC this year regarding a\npossible partnership.</p>\n<p>One thing is for certain, and I'm not the first to say this, Apple cannot\n\"out-pace\" Samsung in processor design and manufacturing if they use Samsung's\nfacilities to make their chips; Samsung will always be on even keel with Apple.\nIf Apple wants to innovate beyond Samsung it needs to move to another supplier,\nand the only one capable of such volumes and quality would be Intel. The two\nwere made for each other.</p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/apple-intel-and-matt-richman","location":"/archive/apple-intel-and-matt-richman/","published":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 ","slug":"apple-intel-and-matt-richman","article-number":9}
