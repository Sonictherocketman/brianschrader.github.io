title: Apple, Intel, and Matt Richman
author: Brian Schrader
status: draft

[Matt Richman][1] brings up a great point. Apple is, in my layman's opinion, too
dependent on their competitor for parts that are essential for its business
(namely its A-series processors). There's been a lot of talk in the community
about how beneficial it would be for Apple and Intel if they were to cooperate,
and Matt points out a great starting point for their negotiations. It'll be very
interesting to see if anything is announced at WWDC this year regarding a
possible partnership.

One thing is for certain, and I'm not the first to say this, Apple cannot
"out-pace" Samsung in processor design and manufacturing if they use Samsung's
facilities to make their chips; Samsung will always be on even keel with Apple.
If Apple wants to innovate beyond Samsung it needs to move to another supplier,
and the only one capable of such volumes and quality would be Intel. The two
were made for each other.
