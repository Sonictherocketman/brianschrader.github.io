But sometimes we need to hear something from someone else for it to really sink in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>If it's a paragraph, it's a post.</b> Medium-sized content gets short shrift these days. Don't go long. One or two paragraphs count. Then press publish.</p>\n<p><b>Negotiate a comfort zone on two axes:</b> personal and public, tech and everything else (feminism, musical theater, MMA, parenting, etc). 2001-era Scribbling.net was too personal, Lifehacker/Smarterware too tech. There's something in the middle.</p>\n<p><b>Traffic is irrelevant.</b> Don't even measure it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://scribbling.net/2014/10/16/short-form-blogging/\">Short-form blogging &#8594;</a></p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/short-form-blogging","location":"/archive/short-form-blogging/","published":"Sun, 02 Nov 2014 ","type":"link","slug":"short-form-blogging","article-number":64}
