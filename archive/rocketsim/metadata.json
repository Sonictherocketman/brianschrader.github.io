The goal of the assignment was to design a rocket to beat the <a href=\"http://wra2.org/WRA2_Class_A_Rules.php\">world record</a> (at time of writing it was 663 meters). </p>\n<p>In the pre-finals rush, I whipped up this simulation and I've uploaded the code to GitHub. It was recommended to do the simulation in MatLab, but I wanted to practice my Python.
