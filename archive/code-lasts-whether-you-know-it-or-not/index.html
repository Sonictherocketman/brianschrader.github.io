          <p>When I <a href="/archive/the-new-new-cms/">first wrote the code</a> to generate this site, and the 4 <a href="/archive/thinking-about-redoing-my-blog-engine/">other</a> times I've <a href="/archive/rewritten/">rewritten it</a> before settling on the current implementation, I don't know if I thought I'd still be blogging, let alone still relying on that code over six years later. To its credit, the code still works well, the last time I touched it was to upgrade to Python 3 in 2016 to get full unicode support ðŸŽ‰, and back in July to fix a bug with JSONFeed dates, but in 2018 it's definitely showing its age.</p>
<p>A pile of mostly undocumented bash and Python scripts and <strong>a bunch</strong> of fragile Python path hacks have allowed me to write these words and so many more over the past 6 years. To this day the site doesn't have a real archive page where posts are collected by year or month, it's just a giant, single page list of articles. Back when I wrote it, I didn't think I'd have enough posts to ever need that, or that if I did, I'd cross that bridge then. I didn't. I've swept it under the rug as a nice-to-have feature for years, and honestly if it became an issue, I'd probably just move to a real system like Jekyll or Wordpress; it'd be so much easier.</p>
<p>I'm reminded of something I saw on Twitter the other day:</p>
<p><img
    alt="An example of some old code that lives on"

    style="max-width:80%;"
/></p>
<p>The code we write exists for as long as <a href="https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1058676834940776450">it's being used</a>.</p>
