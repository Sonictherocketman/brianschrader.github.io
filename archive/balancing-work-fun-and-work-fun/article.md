title: Balancing Work, Fun, and Work-Fun

I develop software for a living. I like to develop software (I'd call it one of my most productive and enjoyable hobbies) and I have lots of projects that I'd love to build in my spare time. The "problem"<sup>[*](#1)</sup> is, I spend the entire workday sitting in front of a computer programming, and I'm not really in the mood, most nights, to do more of it when I get home. 

The question becomes: how do you strike a balance between work, hobbies,  chores, and mindless, unproductive, purely relaxational fun?
