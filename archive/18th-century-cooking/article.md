Every once and a while I come across something on the internet that I don't
know how I ever lived without: [18th Centery Cooking][yt] is one of those
things (well, that and [Primitive Tech][pt]).

The videos have a suspiciously PBS feel, reminicent of shows like [California's Gold][cg] or [Nova][nova].
