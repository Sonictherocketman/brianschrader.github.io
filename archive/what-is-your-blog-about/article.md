title: What is your blog about?

tags: blogging, topics

type: post

When I tell people that I have a blog, they almost always ask me the same question: "What is your blog about?" I never know how to answer that. BiteofanApple is not a (Philosophy|Lifestyle|Productivity|Science|Link) blog, its _my_ blog and its about whatever interests me. A given post could be about anything... as long as I find it interesting. Though to be a little more specific, I use this blog for 2 primary purposes: to publish my thoughts on certain topics, and as a sort of public [Instapaper][1] feed of articles I find interesting.
