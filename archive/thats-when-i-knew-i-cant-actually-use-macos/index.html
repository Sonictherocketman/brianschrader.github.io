            <p>A few months back, I got a new laptop for work: a new 15" MacBook Pro.<sup>1</sup> It was the first time I'd gotten a new Mac since 2014 when I got the MacBook Pro I'm using to write this post; this Mac has been my primary machine ever since. I use it for everything: I built <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com">Adventurer's Codex</a> and <a href="https://pine.blog">Pine.blog</a> with it, I used it for over 4 years as my work computer, I've taken it all across the country and for most of that time I've carried it with me every single day.</p>
<p>In all that time though, I haven't been using macOS as it comes from Apple, I've heavily customized just about everything. I've written tons of little command-line utilities, keyboard macros, Apple Script extensions, and installed bits of extra utilities to make this laptop work <em>exactly</em> the way I want. What's more, when I got this machine, I migrated my previous MacBook onto it. In short, there's now a decade of customizations and tweaks baked into macOS, and it's been long enough now that I have no idea which behaviors are mine and which are part of the macOS that Apple ships.</p>
<p>Which presents a problem when setting up a new Mac.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when I use my Mac, I don't really think about what I'm doing. My hands do things, and the thing I want to happen, does; all in perfect harmony. One thing I knew, coming into this new Mac, was that my hands would likely stumble over this new bigger, chunkier keyboard. I was right, but for this I was prepared. I was less prepared for what came next.</p>
<h3>That Demoralizing Beep</h3>
<p>There I was, welcoming a new friend into the world, stumbling sure, but maintaining my balance. It was then, for what reason I know not, I heard a sound I'd not heard in a long time, a long time: the error chime. Instantly, I was lost, adrift on unfamiliar shores that at first glance looked just like the islands I'd called home for a decade, but which, on second glance turned out to be nothing more than a mirage that obscured the sharp rocks on which I was now adrift.</p>
<p>In a flurry, I reached for <a href="">Alfred</a>. I whacked Command + Space and found only Spotlight. When I asked Spotlight for <code>set</code> and whacked Enter, instead of seeing my familiar System Preferences, I heard only that chime again. I started to panic. It was then I realized that I was truly alone. Pastebot had fallen, Shiori did not heed my call, and Terminal no longer spoke my native tongue. Somehow, I managed to open Safari, but when I searched for <code>alfred</code> I was thrust to Google.com, a far cry from my <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">usual port of call</a>. I was lost; adrift on the farthest shores. Unmoored, scared, and alone.</p>
<p><img alt="Alfred using Settings to Open System Preferences" src="/images/blog/alfred-set.png" /></p>
<p>What was this strange world? I knew not. For now I only knew the screams of error demons emanating from the void.</p>
<h3>The Thrilling Conclusion</h3>
<p>Eventually, through the most heroic of efforts, I managed to install a few utilities, apps, and copy over some scripts from my personal Mac onto this new one. It still doesn't feel like home, but it's close.</p>
<p>This harrowing, 15-minute adventure has caused me to reflect more on how I use my tools. I'm not sure I like knowing that I'll either need to migrate this Mac forever, or that I'll need to start over and rebuild my foundations sometime in the future. I like my shortcuts, but that's just it: they're mine, not Apple's not yours, not anyone else's; just mine. I'm not sure I want the burden of migrating or re-learning everything. Is the only answer for me to slowly wean myself off of my little tweaks, my time-savers? I'm not sure.</p>
<p>But it's been interesting to think about.</p>
<div class="footnote">
    <sup>1</sup> This was prior to the 16" coming out.<br />
    <sup>2</sup> Somehow Alfred knows that "set", short for Settings, refers to System Preferences. I have no idea how it learned this or when, but I've never once asked for that app by its real name.
