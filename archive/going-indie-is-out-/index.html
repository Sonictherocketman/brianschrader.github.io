<p>Today I'm thrilled to announce that my book, Going Indie: A Complete Guide to becoming an Independent Software Developer, <a href="https://goingindie.tech">is out and available to purchase</a>! The book has been in pre-order for a few weeks, but today is the official launch!</p>
<p>Writing and publishing a book has been a crazy endeavor, and I've learned a lot during the process, both about myself and my capabilities, and about the process and work involved in book publishing.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who proof-read the book and who contributed to making it a reality. Like it says in the acknowledgements, a special thanks must go to my editor and friend, Jenn Sardina, who helped me wrangle the book from the rambling that it was into the sleek product it became. Thanks to my proof-readers, to my designer, and to all of my friends and family for their support during this process.</p>
<p>There's a lot of improvements I'd like to make to the book, and perhaps there's a second edition on the horizon someday. For now, to all of those who've purchased a copy of Going Indie, I say thank you. I hope you enjoy the book and I hope that it helps convince you to go indie yourselves.</p>
