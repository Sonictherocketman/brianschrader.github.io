A small bug, but one you should fix ASAP. Whether it's download behavior, the color of some box, the font somewhere is too small, or your French localization of some text is overflowing some button, either way, it's a pain. You fix the problem locally, and submit a new build, but Apple still takes a week to review it. Meanwhile your users are having to deal with this bug that you've already solved. It's a common problem, and a frustrating and often a sales affecting one at that.</p>\n<p>On a <a href=\"http://atp.fm/episodes/74\">recent episode of ATP</a>, <a href=\"http://www.marco.org\">Marco</a> mentioned that he could change quite a few features of the app from the server-side. Combine this with <a href=\"http://inessential.com\">Brent Simmon's</a> way of building <a href=\"http://vesperapp.co\">Vesper</a> (i.e. using plists to configure colors, fonts, item sizes, etc) and it seems to me that it should be possible to make iOS apps that are entirely configurable from the server-side. This got me thinking. Why not build the app to download it's configuration file (i.e. plist, or Localization.strings file) remotely? Sure it's not as convenient as Apple's built in frameworks sometimes, but it would allow developers to fix features, colors, themes, and localization issues all remotely.</p>\n<p>I haven't looked into the technical issues with this approach and there is an argument to be made that not all iOS devs want to run a server just to host their .strings files, but if you're already running a server for some other functionality in your app, it's basically cost free and avoids quite a few small but irritating problems.</p>\n<p>My motto: If it can be on the server, it should be on the server. The client doesn't need to worry about it, it just needs to display it.</p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/changing-app-behavior-server-side","location":"/archive/changing-app-behavior-server-side/","published":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 ","title":"Changing App Behavior Server-Side","slug":"changing-app-behavior-server-side","article-number":36}
