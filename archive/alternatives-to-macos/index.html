					<p>Like lots of passionate Mac users, I've been keeping tabs on the "State of the Mac" discussions in the last few months. I don't feel like I'm as disappointed as most in Apple's hardware, but I do think that macOS could use some real attention as some annoying bugs have slipped into the last few updates to my Mac. I'm still using El Capitan and liking it a lot, and my 2014 13" Retina Macbook Pro is still my favorite computer ever. Overall I'm happy with my setup, but Apple's future for the Mac still worries me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I deeply value the consistency, versatility, reliability and integration of Mac OS X and the excellent quality hardware it runs on...</p>
<p>Of course even if I make the switch there are a number of possible drawbacks, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time required to find replacements for all the software I use.</li>
<li>The lack of equally high standard replacements for software...</li>
</ul>
<p>Elementary is stunning and definitely my favourite. It wonâ€™t appeal to everyone but their philosophies and direction really resonate with me. Specifically they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human Interface Guidelines</li>
<li>A primary, native programming language (Vala, no Python and JS \o/).</li>
<li>A model for funding ongoing development (Bug bounties, Patreon, asking for payment when downloading).</li>
<li>Designers as well as developers on the team.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just casually looking at Elementary, I have to say I really like the look of it. If I was going to switch right now, which I'm certainly not, I would use Elementary. Actually if I ever want a nice Linux GUI for anything, I'd probably use Elementary.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The biggest switching cost for me is still the lack of comparable software on any other platform. The Mac's software ecosystem is fantastic (though a lot of people complain about how it could be so much more, it's still the best by a long shot). There just aren't alternatives for most of the fantastic software I have installed on my Mac. I need more than just a good terminal and web browser.</p>

<sup>1</sup> I've been using Linux Mint with Cinnamon for over a year at work and I recommend that too. Cinnamon feels more like Windows and it looks like Elementary feels more like a Mac.</div>
