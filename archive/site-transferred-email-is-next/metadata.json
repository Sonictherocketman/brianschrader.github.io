I haven't added the new features to my blog engine yet, but I'll get to that. First though is the problem of what do I do with my email. Currently, its hosted with my domain provider and part of my shared hosting plan (which I no longer need). I'm looking to move my email off of my domain provider to something more private. I'm thinking about Rackspace or Zoho right now.</p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions please let me know. I'm looking to host 2-4 email addresses as cost effectively as possible (calendar and contact syncing is not needed. iCloud does that just fine).</p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/site-transferred-email-is-next","location":"/archive/site-transferred-email-is-next/","published":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 ","slug":"site-transferred-email-is-next","article-number":57}
