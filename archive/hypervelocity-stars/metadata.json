These stars, he reasoned, were periodically ejected from their host galaxy by some sort of mechanism to begin traveling through interstellar space.</p>\n<p>And now, in a series of papers that published in arXiv Astrophysics, two Harvard researchers have argued that some of these stars may be traveling close to the speed of light. Known as semi-relativistic hypervelocity stars (SHS), these fast-movers are apparently caused by galactic mergers, where the gravitational effect is so strong that it fling stars out of a galaxy entirely. These stars, the researchers say, may have the potential to spread life throughout the Universe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Really cool. I find myself thinking about what life would be like on a planet orbiting a star that's zooming around the universe, at 3% the speed of light(!), while constantly under the effects of relativity. I can't help but think it would make a great setting for a novel (or a Doctor Who episode).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.universetoday.com/116872/planets-could-travel-along-with-rogue-hypervelocity-stars-spreading-life-throughout-the-universe/\">Planets Could Travel Along with Rogue 'Hypervelocity' Stars, Spreading Life Throughout the Universe &#8594;</a></p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/hypervelocity-stars","location":"/archive/hypervelocity-stars/","published":"Wed, 03 Dec 2014 ","title":"Hypervelocity Stars","slug":"hypervelocity-stars","article-number":77}
