SpaceUp is an [unconference][1] for space enthusuasts, and [SpaceUp San
Diego][2] is rolling around again. If you're in San Diego the weekend of October 31st, you should [register][3] now.

I've been going to SpaceUps since the very first one in 2010, and every time it's a fantastic experience. People come from all different walks of life: space bloggers, professors, SpaceX and Xcor employees, and students, to talk about Faster Than Light (FTL) travel, colonizing Mars, NASA's current political situation, and designing Rocket Refuling Stations supplied by an ocean based gas canon (seriously).

To anyone who's been to a [barcamp][4], the format of SpaceUp will be
suspiciously familiar. At the beginning of the day, there's an empty schedule.
Attendents suggest topics that they'd like to talk about or hear about, and
then everybody picks which talks they want to go to. 

If you're interested at all in space or space exploration, you should be going
to SpaceUp. If you aren't in San Diego (which is unfortunate for a whole
other set of reasons &#128526;) then there's a [whole suite of SpaceUps all over
the world][5] so you'll have no excuse.
