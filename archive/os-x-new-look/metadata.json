One thing that sticks out to me, and a few others, is the question of what will happen to OS X this June. Many assumed that it would get a re-skin along with iOS 7, and it didn't. OS X Mavericks did remove a lot of extraneous skeuomorphic elements of OS X, but the basic visual structure remains unchanged. That begs the question though, whether Apple will revamp the visuals this year to make the Mac look similar, but hopefully not exactly, like iOS 7. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dexwell_\">@Dexwell_</a> tweeted his re-skin of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dexwell_/status/456495401638830080/photo/1\">OS X Finder</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dexwell_/status/453154821315768320/photo/1\">\"About this Mac\"</a> window recently and I have to say, I love the look. I've also noticed recently that Spotify's new desktop app looks very iOS 7-y and I think it works really well on the Mac. Could these be the style that Apple leans toward if they are re-skinning OS X? If so, I love it. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Spotify's new look\" src=\"http://brianschrader.com/images/blog/spotify-new-look.png\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"OS X Finder, by @Dexwell_. All credit goes to him.
