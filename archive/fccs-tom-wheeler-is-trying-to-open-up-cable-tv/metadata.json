I'd love TV to be a more direct channel-to-home system. I don't think I'd ever go back to watching on-air TV (something reserved for sportsball parties at friend's houses), but its nice to see progress.</p>\n<p>I have to wonder though, what changed? Why would the FCC decide that it's going to disobey its lobbyist for the public good now, and not 6 months ago? Did we really have that big of an impact with Net Neutrality, or is this a fluke?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/28/7086473/a-real-apple-tv-might-finally-happen\">The real Apple TV might finally happen if the FCC gets what it wants &#8594;</a></p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/fccs-tom-wheeler-is-trying-to-open-up-cable-tv","location":"/archive/fccs-tom-wheeler-is-trying-to-open-up-cable-tv/","published":"Sun, 02 Nov 2014 ","title":"FCC's Tom Wheeler is trying to open up cable TV","type":"post","slug":"fccs-tom-wheeler-is-trying-to-open-up-cable-tv","article-number":66}
