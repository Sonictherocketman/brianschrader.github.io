          <p>It's been <a href="/archive/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/">15 days now</a> since I unofficial-officially left Twitter, and I have a few thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>I'll admit, the first 3 days without Twitter <em>sucked</em>. I was constantly texting everyone I knew, trying to get them to convince me to go back, but to no avail. I wanted to constantly check up and read what people were posting, I wanted, and still want to take part in the bigger conversations that happen on Twitter. To be clear, I said that I would be leaving Twitter as my main platform, and I have, but I do still like to read Twitter, to check up on my friends, and I'm still replying to mentions and the like.</p>
<p>After the first week, I found myself wanting to check Twitter less, but I still wanted an outlet for my sparratic thoughts; enter <a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a>. I have a full <a href="http://sonicrocketman.snippets.xyz">microblog</a> there, and I it set up to cross-post to Twitter. Overall this system has been working great for me. I get the conversations from Twitter, and I'm in control of the content. </p>
<p><a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a> is still in beta, and I'm lucky to be a tester for it, but when it comes out, I'll be sure to let you all know. Since it's just a Jekyll blog though, you can follow it with any plain-old RSS reader (yay Open Web!).</p>
<p>I'm now treating Twitter like I have always treated Facebook: as a place to cross-post things, and respond to comments with the real content residing on my blog, as it should. </p>
<hr />
<p><small>P.S. Another thing I've noticed is that I have a lot more down time now that I'm not checking Twitter every 5 minutes.</small></p>
