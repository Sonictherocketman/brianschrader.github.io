            <p>I'd like to share this excerpt from the episode <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/81">81 of the Accidental Tech Podcast</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong> I got, what I felt to be a considerable amount of hate, and a considerable amount of yelling directed at me on Twitter because I had said that I wanted to think for a minute before I spoke and it really upset me a lot, and it really bothered me...</p>
<p>The thing that was really upsetting about all this, the thing that really bothered me and continues to bother me about all this... is I dealt with three hours of a handful of people being  meaner than I think was necessary, and it kinda messed me up for a while. That was three hours. Nobody threatened to rape me, nobody threatened to murder me, nobody sent me disgusting pronography</p>
<p><strong>Marco:</strong> Nobody, like, came to your house.</p>
<p><strong>John:</strong> Nobody said they knew your address and knew your family's address and were going to kill them, and showed you pictures of your family that they'd taken secretly.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong> Yes, and I felt like a piece of crap after this three hours which had none of those thing, and it occurred to me: If I feel like a piece of just utter crap after three hours of people saying, "Oh, you're not doing enough. You should't think about that. Nuanced!? Are you kidding me?" Three hours of that and I felt like I wanted to crawl in a hole and just go away for a week, and that was three hours. I cannot freaking fathom what it's like to be a woman in... technology and especially in gaming...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's right. It's hard to realize that people, and women more commonly go through that kind of crap every day. This isn't a discussion about some topic with equal sides. That kind of behavior is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Here's the audio trimming. Hearing it has a lot more power than reading it, I think.</p>
