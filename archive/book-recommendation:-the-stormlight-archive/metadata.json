If you haven't heard of this series, or its author you <em>need</em> to check it out. The planned 10-part series takes place in a war-torn land of failing kings, squabbling princedoms, and magical knights long thought to be gone forever. </p>\n<p>When the king is assassinated by a mysterious man with powers no one should have, the kingdom goes to war with his employer. All the while a young surgeon, turned soldier, turned slave discovers his powers, and a young girl tries to steal from the most respected and hated scholar in the world. </p>\n<p>If that little paragraph intro doesn't sell you, try a sample of the <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Way-of-Kings-Audiobook/B003ZWFO7E/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1408310992&amp;sr=1-1\">Audible version of the book</a>. The narrators are amazing as they bring Sanderson's enormous world to life.</p>\n<p>I listened to the books via Audible, and I'd highly recommend them. The books are long (it is <em>Epic</em> fantasy after all) clocking in at around 1100 pages (45 hours of audio). It's a significant investment, but one that you'll be hooked to for every page/minute. </p>\n<p>If Audible sponsored, I'm sure that they'd give me a code for you to try the book, but I think you can try it via their 14-day trial anyway.</p>\n<p>Give it a shot, the books were amazing. The bad thing is that, having finished them, I have to wait another <a href=\"http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive\">2 years</a> to read the next one...</p>","link":"http://brianschrader.com/archive/book-recommendation:-the-stormlight-archive","location":"/archive/book-recommendation:-the-stormlight-archive/","published":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 ","title":"Book Recommendation: The Stormlight Archive","slug":"book-recommendation:-the-stormlight-archive","article-number":37}
