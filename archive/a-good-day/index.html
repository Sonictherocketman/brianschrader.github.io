					<p>Some days go well. Aside from all of the extremely troubling things in the world right now, today was great. In the morning, <a href="https:////adventurerscodex.com/">Adventurer's Codex</a> got one step closer to its next release (which is going to be a big one) and in the evening, a set of features I've been building for a few months, and <a href="/archive/the-web-as-a-social-network/">wanting for a few years</a>, got pushed out to <a href="https://pine.blog/">Pine.blog</a> along with a refreshed home page that I put together in the last few hours.</p>
<p>The full details of the <a href="https://pine.blog/">Pine.blog</a> release <a href="https://blog.pine.blog/2020/03/pine-blog-and-the-social-web/">are posted on the official blog</a> but the important bit is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the latest version of Pine.blog, one-click replies have arrived on the Open Web. Bloggers on Pine.blog now have the ability to reply to posts in their timelines, anything in the Feed Directory, and even to other replies!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've wanted this feature for a long time. Replies, combined with the silent launch of Webmentions earlier this year finally turns Pine.blog from a feed reader and a blogging platform into a full blown social network powered by the Open Web. This was the goal of my <a href="/archive/the-open-microblog-standard/">Microblogger</a> project back in the day, it was part of my <a href="/archive/a-vision-of-the-open-web/">Vision for the Open Web</a>, and it's been my <a href="/archive/twitter-and-the-open-web/">dream ever since 2014</a> when I was still using Twitter and hoping it would evolve into what Pine.blog is now (granted on a <em>much</em> smaller scale).</p>
<p>Don't let anyone tell you that you can't accomplish your dreams: you can. It might take a lot longer than you thought, but it can be done.</p>
<p>No more do we have to imagine what the Web as a Social Network could be. We have it, we just need to encourage others to join us. Whether you're using your own IndieWeb site, Pine.blog, or Micro.blog you're helping to make the Web better.</p>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but I can now include Pine.blog in that list without qualification.</p>
