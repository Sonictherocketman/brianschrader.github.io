<p>Today I'm announcing <a href="https://pine.blog">Pine, a new kind of RSS Reader and Microblogging client</a>. I've been developing Pine, in addition to a bunch of other projects for a while now, and it's finally time to show it off to the world.</p>
<p>In a classical sense, Pine is a Feed Reader, but it's really more of a successor to my old <a href="/archive/microblogger-status-updates-and-more/">Microblogger project</a> from way back. Not only can users follow the people and sites they want, but you can also use Pine to post to your own Wordpress site and find new sites and people using the built in search. In a lot of ways Pine and <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> are similar with a few key differences and, from what I can tell, both Manton and I started working on them at around the same time. Pine is my contribution to a new ecosystem of open social networking tools and services. Anyone on Micro.blog can follow people on Pine and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Pine is also my first venture into building paid software. It's $5 per month and at that price I don't have to sell ads or do anything shady to earn money.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to post anything about Pine until it officially launched, but now that it has, I've got a few interesting design decisions I'd like to talk about. Building a feed reader has always been on my to-do list, and it turns out that there's a lot more to it than just parsing feeds.</p>
<p>I've got a lot of great new features planned, including an iOS app which should be coming soon. If you're interested, give Pine a shot, and let me know what you think!</p>
