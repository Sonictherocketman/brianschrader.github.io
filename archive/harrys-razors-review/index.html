					<p>A little over a month ago, I needed to buy more razor blades. I hate buying razor blades. Its annoying, and it costs way too much. I think I had just finished listening to an episode of <a href="http://atp.fm">ATP</a> or <a href="http://daringfireball.net">The Talk Show</a> and they'd had <a href="https://www.harrys.com">Harry's</a> as a sponsor. So I looked up their prices, and immediately noticed that they were half the price of the Gillette ones I usually buy, so I took the plunge, entered the promo code, and ordered their starter set (which, turns out, was exactly the same price as a 4-pack of Gillette razors). Three days later, this arrived in the mail.</p>
<p><img alt="The starter pack" src="/images/blog/harrys-razors.jpg" /></p>
<p>That next morning I took to using my new set of razors. After some initial confusion on how to get the razors on and off the handle (if you read the instructions, you won't have this problem), I got right to shaving. </p>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that these razors are sharp, really sharp which makes for a great shave overall. The shaving cream is minty and feels cool on your face, and its not a foam, but a cream. I'd never used a shaving cream like that before, and now all the foam ones feel weird by comparison. </p>
<p>As I said, these blades are sharp, and if you aren't watching what you're doing, you will get cut. I'm a pretty clumsy shaver, and I don't typically pay too much attention to how I'm holding this incredibly sharp piece of steel that's gliding up and down my throat, so of course I cut myself. Since then, I've been a little more careful, and it's never happened again. It wasn't a fault of the blades, but of me not noticing how sharp they were.</p>
<p>In a little over a month, I've gone through three blades, and I just ordered my refill set today (I shave about 3-5 times a week so that's not a bad turnaround). I'm personally thrilled to be using them, and I prefer them immensely to other commercial brand razors. The shaving cream is excellent, and the blades are sharp and they stay sharp for quite a long time (much longer, it seems, than Gillette razors which are usually only good for about a week). One thing I will recommend though, is to get the <a href="https://www.harrys.com/products/the-winston-set">Winston</a> razor set. The difference between that and the regular one is that the Winston is made from aluminum. The regular plastic ones (like mine) are great to hold and have a nice weight to them, but every time I use it, I tell myself that I should have paid the extra $5 for the aluminum one. Hopefully I'll be buying one soon, (plus it just looks amazing).</p>
<p>I highly recommend <a href="https://www.harrys.com">Harry's</a> and I, for one, am going to be buying from them for a long time. They're cheaper than other blades, they last longer than other blades, and they're a better quality than other blades. That's really what you want after all. Great job guys! Keep it up.</p>
<p><span id="note" style="font-size:small;">
Just as a disclaimer: Harry's did not ask me to post this review, nor are they giving me anything for doing so. This was entirely because I enjoyed their product and wanted to give them a shout out for the awesome job they're doing.
