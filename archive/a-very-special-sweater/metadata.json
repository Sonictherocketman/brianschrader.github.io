"content" : "<center><p>\nThere once was a tree, just an ordinary tree, <br>\nAn ordinary tree with a dream, <br>\nTo be the tallest tree on the hillside, <br>\nIt loved the coastal breeze, <br>\nAnd to stretch out its leaves, <br>\nAnd it loved all the birds that called it home. <br>\n<br>\nOne day the winds came howling, roaring, goring and growling,<br>\nThey caught the tree off guard, <br>\nAnd waived it back and forth, <br>\nIts roots could hold no more, <br>\nAnd down it went,<br>\n<br>\nAnd so the tree laid there, sad and frozen stiff, <br>\nUntil a smart young student came about, <br>\nShe saw the poor tree shivering, <br>\nShe knew the tree was cold and all alone. <br>\n<br>\nShe gave the tree a present, <br>\nTo keep it warm and cheery, <br>\nAnd now the tree is happy once again. <br>\n<br>\nSo if you see a tree, sad and all alone, <br>\nWhy not knit it a cozy little sweater. <br>\nIt would make the tree so happy, <br>\nAnd it will make you happy too, <br>\nAnd it will give passers-by a laugh. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://images.biteofanapple.com/blog/tree-with-sweater.jpg\">\n\t<img class=\"body-image-center\" src=\"http://images.biteofanapple.com/blog/tree-with-sweater.jpg\" style=\"width:60%;\">\n</a>\n<br>\n<br>\nCheers to you: fallen-tree-sweater-knitter. </center>"
