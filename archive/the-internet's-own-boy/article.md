I just finished watching _The Internet's Own Boy_, the documentary detailing the life and tragic death of one of, in my opinion, America's great activists. Long story short: watch this documentary, really, just do it. It's licensed under [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA][cc] so torrent it if you want. 

Then, when you are sufficiently riled, and fed up with the way our government pursues "justice", donate to [The Mayday PAC][pac]. It's still accepting donations and they need support.
