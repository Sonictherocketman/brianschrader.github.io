					<p>It's been a little over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service">5 years since Google Reader shut down</a> and the world of RSS readers was tossed into the junk drawer of collective memory. But, looking back on it today, I'd actually argue that RSS and Feeds as a whole never really disappeared, only the Feed Readers did.</p>
<p>In building <a href="https://pine.blog">Pine</a>, and as a long time Feed Reader user, I've been pleasantly surprised over these last 5 years to see that most sites still have RSS feeds. Sure, Facebook and Twitter don't support them, but YouTube, Reddit, Squarespace, Wordpress and so many more do by default.</p>
<p>Feeds of all kinds still exist, nearly forgotten, in the markup of most websites, and this means that Feed Readers can, and will, make a comeback someday. The foundations are already laid; the hard work is done. RSS Feeds became a standard, and were built into the tools we use to make the web today. It's almost as if we laid the tracks and built the trains for a trans-continental railroad, but we've just forgotten how to sell tickets.</p>
<p>What we're waiting for now is a resurgence and a new interpretation of what a Feed Reader can or should be. Sites like <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> focus heavily on building a social network of readers and microbloggers, while <a href="https://pine.blog">Pine</a> focuses on discovering new and exciting people and sites to follow and new ways to interact with them, and <a href="http://rivernewsapp.com">RiverNews</a> is a more traditional reader.</p>
<p>Others have said this, but I think it's more true by the day: the Feed Readers, they're coming back.</p>
