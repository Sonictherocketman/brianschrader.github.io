<h1>Section 1: Overview</h1>
</div>
<div id="overview">
<h2>Overview: What is this?</h2>
<p>In recent years our internet communication has been increasingly controlled by single private companies. Facebook and Twitter account for an enormous percentage of online communication. This isn't good. Private companies (that aren't treated as utilities) have a number of factors that prevent them from being pure communications networks. Private companies need to make money, then need to constantly make <em>more</em> money, and they need to serve changing needs. They need to upgrade their service and add "features". This means that their goals will never align entirely with the goal of open, untampered internet communication. There's one more problem: Private companies can die. They go away. Twitter and Facebook sit high now, but in 10 years? 5 years even? Will they still be around? Hard to say. Communications that are tied to services and companies like this will die with the companies that built them. This is the problem that the Open Microblog tries to solve.</p>
<p>The Open Microblog is a proposed standard for an open and easy internet communication mechanism. It is based on the success of RSS and is platform independent. It allows for most of the features that services like Twitter and Facebook provide but in an open way.</p>
</div>
<div id="use">
<h2>What is it used for?</h2>
<p>Open Microblogger is an open standard for a distributed, real-time, internet based communications service. Using a model based on RSS, Open Microblogger allows any developer, or savvy user to build and host their own microblogging service modeled after Twitter. The biggest upside to Open Microblogger is that it isn't controlled by a central corporation or body thus it remains, like RSS, outside the realm of corporate reach.</p>
<p>Social Networks are the cornerstone of the modern internet world. People all over the world use them to communicate with each other. The importance of this information being tamper-free and delivered in real-time is one thing that services like Twitter have excelled at recently. However services like Twitter and Facebook are controlled by a single entity, the fate's of all the information they carry is dictated by the needs of that particular company needing to make money. This means that our communication, the things we use to share events and news around the world is controlled by a single company and it's pockets.</p>
<p>Information regarding world events, social injustice, and social upheaval is just too much to allow a single corporation to handle. Not for any act of malevolence by that company but rather because companies need to make money, and if they don't they could disappear. If Twitter disappeared tomorrow, the world would almost certainly cease to hear about events all over the world and would have to go backward to other means. The idea of Twitter, of instant access to the information you want from the source is too good to let die or be corrupted. That is the mission of Open Microblogger, to create a standard by which anyone can develop a system, free of corporate overlords, that users can use to plug into the web of information that is microblogging.</p>
</div>
<div id="rss">
<h2>Why not just use RSS? It's already there...</h2>
<p>True, but the Open Microblogger Standard allows for more social interaction and functionality than the broadcast-only medium that is RSS. Open Microblogger is meant to supplement RSS as another means of communicating. You'll see further down, there is a lot that Open Microblogger can do that RSS just can't.</p>
</div>
<div id="cool_name">
<h2>Why doesn't it have a cool name?</h2>
<p>I know, the name is terrible. I haven't thought of a good one yet.</p>
</div>
<div id="terms">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p><em>User</em>: A person/company who has an account. This may also mean the account that belongs to a given person/company.</p>
<p><em>Client</em>: An application used for viewing, posting, or sharing content on this service (web site, mobile app, etc).</p>
<p><em>Service</em>: An application (usually a web based service) that provides data aggregation and collection capabilities (i.e. the feed crawling servers, etc).</p>
<p><em>Standard's Level</em>: Any functionality or feature-set provided by the standard with no additional work required by the service or client.</p>
<p><em>Service's Level</em>: Any functionality or feature-set provided by a given service. Service Level tasks can be anything from post favoriting functionality, user search functionality, etc. In some cases (see Replies/Mentions) the Standard has formalized a set of guidelines for Service Level features/functionality.</p>

<h1>Section 2: The Feed: Layout and Features</h1>
</div>
<div id="feed">
<h2>The Feed</h2>
<p>Each user has a feed. This feed should follow the format listed in section 3. The feed represents the user's post history (what they've posted, reposted, and replies they've sent). This feed also contains certain metadata about the user including their username, user_id, reply_to information, and their most recent statuses.</p>
<p>Its important to remember that the feed holds the truth. There is not central database for user data, and all of a user's posts should be able to be found by traversing the feed and following public URLs found in it.</p>
<h3>Feed Paging</h3>
<p>Due to the high volume of posts common to microblogs, the feed if left unchecked, could grow to be unwieldy in a short time. To combat this it is recommended that a user's feed be paginated to include no more that the user's 500 most recent posts or the most recent posts for a feed file size of up to 500 KB, whichever comes first. This should keep the file size small enough to be easily transmitted over the web.</p>
<p>The XML archive of the user's posts should not be deleted once the user has filled their 500 KB quota. The standard provides a way for the feed to link to the next previous feed via the next_node tag. Once a user has filled their current XML feed to the limit above, that file should be moved and archived in a publicly accessible location, and a new feed added to the user's feed URL location. In this new feed, a URL to the new location of the previous feed should be added to the next_node tag. This allows the current feed to act as normal, and the old posts to be accessed via the next_node URL. In practice, the user would have a multitude of these XML files all linking to each other like a singly-linked-list, each with a URL to the next node and the head node.</p>
<h3>Relocation, What happens if the user changes services?</h3>
<p>The crucial feature of Open Microblog is that it is designed to be platform and service independent. Users have the ultimate choice to stop, start, relocate, and remove their data from a service at will. In order to migrate services easily, and without losing followers, services should provide a mechanism for users to input a redirect URL in their feed. This item is denoted with the \ tag. This tag should <em>only</em> be present if the user is relocating; it should never be empty. The value in that tag is the URL of the user's new feed. This tag should give the followers of said user adequate time to migrate over to the new feed URL before the old service deletes the user's feed.</p>
<h4>Obligation of the old Service</h4>
<p>If a user is choosing to leave your service, you have an obligation to keep their old feed public for at least 24 hours to allow the user's new choice of service to import the data.</p>
<h4>Obligation of the new Service</h4>
<p>Conversely, services that the user is migrating to, should prompt the user for a link to their old feed and copy it over to their system. The old service is not obligated to keep that old feed around for long, so make sure to get it quickly.</p>
<h4>Obligation of the Client</h4>
<p>Clients who come across a \ tag should immediately redirect their crawlers at this new feed URL. The old URL can be discarded and is considered dead.</p>
</div>
<div id="rt">
<h2>Reposts</h2>
<p>Reposting (similar to Twitter's retweeting) is the posting of someone else's post to your own timeline. The information from the original post is preserved in the reposted tags, and includes data link original user_id, status_id, and a link to that user's feed.</p>
</div>
<div id="reply">
<h2>Replies/Mentions</h2>
<p>Since a user will receive posts from all people/accounts that they follow, Replies/Mentions from those people are delivered automatically via the normal feed. It is up to the service to determine whether or not to show users all mentions or just the ones to people the user also follows (though the latter is recommended).</p>
<p>The question remains, what of Replies/Mentions from those that a user doesn't follow? Due to the broadcast-only nature of the standard this feature must be delegated to the Service Level, though the standard does provide a simple and standardized way for services to provide this feature to users easily.</p>
<h3>Mentions URLs</h3>
<p>In the channel declaration an optional element can be declared called reply_to. If a given service chooses to implement this feature, the reply_to element contains a simple set of elements that allow the client to form a URL string with the required data to the service of the user being replied to. Services opting-in to Mentions should be able to receive URL request measages from this URL and pass them on to the user they belong to.</p>
