During development we ran into a couple of interesting challenges with integrating such a mature system with our new-ish web stack, one of which was User Authentication.</p>
<p>The majority of Adventurer's Codex uses an OAuth Provider model for user authentication but Ejabberd (our XMPP server) requires that the username and password be sent at connection time. Obviously we didn't want to have two different auth schemes to support, and we didn't want our client app to store any passwords (hence OAuth). We spent a while hunting for different possible solutions, and in the end we stumbled into a really simple one.</p>
<p>Ejabberd allows for authentication to be handled by an external script, which allows us to use our core database as the auth backend. We could, in principle, use a Django management command to make a call to our database, hash the password that we were given by the client and compare it to the one stored in our database, but not only is that a lot of work and error prone, it's too coupled to our database layer, and it still required the client to store the user's password.</p>
<p>In the end we went with what might seem like the obvious solution: just keep using OAuth. After the client receives the initial user data at load time, it sends the same OAuth token as the password along with the user's XMPP JID to Ejabberd. Ejabberd then calls out to an external script which makes an HTTP request to our API to see if the user exists and that the token is valid. Clean and simple.</p>
<p><img alt="A visualization of the OAuth over XMPP process." src="/images/blog/xmpp-auth.svg" /></p>
<p>There's a few major advantages to using this method. First, The client no longer has to store user passwords, which not only makes our implementation simpler, but also protects our users from a whole host of attacks. Second, the user's XMPP session is now bound to the same limits as the rest of their access to the site which greatly simplifies permissions handling. Third, and perhaps the most interesting is that Ejabberd is no longer tied to either the Django CLI or the database and can be spun off as essentially a separate microservice on another machine.</p>

<p><img alt="todolist terminal output" src="/images/blog/todolist-update.png" /></p>
<p>I had to remove the temp file because it was actually causing performance problems with BBEdit. Since the temp file came into and out of existence every few seconds, BBEdit's project view would dutifully redraw the project file list twice in quick succession, wasting quite a bit of CPU power<sup>1</sup>, and sometimes causing my MacBook's fan to spin up. Now that the temp file is gone, that problem is too.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<sup>1. </sup>I'm not sure why BBEdit needs so much power to redraw the project list and I've reached out to their support. Hopefully they can resolve the issue. At the very least my script is a little more well behaved so it's no longer an issue.

To help me keep track of all of these TODOs in my code I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/Sonictherocketman/77dd6cd8fd907dbbc00031acb08f3ba0">little script yesterday</a> and I've put it on Github for anyone who's interested.</p>
<p>The script looks through all of the code (by default Python code) in a given destination directory, greps for the <code>TODO</code> comments, and prints them nicely in a constantly updated list in the terminal. The output looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Todolist Terminal Window" src="/images/blog/todolist-terminal.png" /></p>
<p>Writing this script I learned a couple of new things about terminal commands like how to clear the screen without deleting the scrollback or just printing newlines (i.e. what <code>clear</code> does). I've put the script in my <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and called it <code>todolist</code> so now I can invoke it from anywhere and get a nice little list of what I've put off working on.</p>

Even at my current job, I'm the the lead and only full-time developer. In more recent projects (including <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com">Adventurer's Codex</a>) this means that I'm the DevOps guy and System Admin as well. I'm by no means an expert in either, but I can do both.</p>
<p>I started learning how to manage and administer servers when I started this site back in 2012. Back then I never thought that all of those hours spent configuring Apache and PHP would lead to anything, but those countless hours of frustration taught me the basics. Fast-forward 5 years and I'm developing three major projects (two unannounced) and I'm DevOps and SysAdmin for all three. It's crazy to think about.</p>
<p>I'd highly recommend any new developers to follow the same general path I did: start a project or blog and learn to deploy it yourself. I started with a cheap old-style webhost and FTP, and slowly moved to managing the whole stack on Linode. I'm using Docker on new projects, and for now, I'm scripting my own deploys (though this could change soon if I migrate one project to Ansible).</p>
<p>As developers it's sometimes easy to forget that we write software that actually runs on some actual hardware in some actual datacenter somewhere. Knowing how to do many of the things that DevOps and SysAdmins do will not only make you a better developer, it gives you the ability to do more on your own. You often don't need tons of layers of software to deploy yours if you know how to do it from the ground up (especially if it's a smaller project). Those tools make it easier sure, but they're not required.</p>", "date_published": "2017-09-26T12:30:00", "title": "Accidental DevOps", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/accidental-devops/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/getting-back-on-the-horse/", "tags": ["update", "blogging"], "content_html": "<p>It's been a while since my last post. This whole summer has been an unusually quiet here, and while a number of personal issues have cropped up this summer that derailed me from blogging, I've really just gotten out of the habit of writing regularly. This is me forcing myself back onto that horse. I've got some exciting news coming, and between work and Adventurer's Codex, I've been keeping myself way too busy.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com">Adventurer's Codex</a> front: we're in the middle of a large refactor caused by our ongoing migration to Webpack which should hopefully fix a bug caused by our fairly primitive current build and deploy system. We're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel now, and hopefully it shouldn't take much longer before we're back to writing new, cool features. The original build and deploy system was basically a lot of manual work and a shell script. When we wrote it, I had no idea what Webpack was or how to deploy a modern front-end app, now I do. That's what happens when you learn on the go; sometimes you have to step back and fix your past mistakes.</p>
<p>In my dwindling spare time, I've been working on another project that I hope to announce soon, so look for more to come there.</p>", "date_published": "2017-09-25T16:20:00", "title": "Getting Back on the Horse", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/getting-back-on-the-horse/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/todos-as-a-templating-system/", "tags": ["software development", "programming", "thought technology"], "content_html": "<p>When I sit down to start a new feature or project the blank page or empty function can be extremely intimidating; a void of infinite complexity. I'm sure lots of developers do this, and maybe most don't realize it, but I've found that <code>TODO</code> comments are super useful in helping to abstract away nitpicky details and focus on the overall purpose of the code as I'm writing it. Let's say that we want to validate some parameters from an HTTP request and kick off a background task to send an email to a list of requested users. First off, we need to handle the request and kick off the task, but there's a bunch of validation and database queries we need to make before we can do that, and we haven't even written the task function yet, that's where <code>TODOs</code> come in.</p>
<pre><code>class MassEmailView(APIView)
    # TODO: check if user has permission to send mass mail
    def post(self, request):
        # TODO: Get users from the request
        users = []
        for user in users:
            # TODO: send the message
            pass
        return Response(None, status=200)
</code></pre>
<p>Right off the bat I know that I need to get a list of users and do something with each of them. In a lot of ways I'm basically writing pseudo-code and slowly filling in the blanks with real code. Next, let's say we write the background task.</p>
<pre><code># ---- tasks.py ----
@shared_task
def send_email(user, subject, message_text):
    email.send(user.email, subject, text=message_text)

# ---- views.py ----
class MassEmailView(APIView)
    # TODO: check if user has permission to mass send mail
    def post(self, request):
        # TODO: Get users, subject, and text from the request
        users = []
        subject = ''
        text = ''
        for user in users:
            tasks.send_email.delay(user, subject, text)
        return Response(None, status=200)
</code></pre>
<p>Slowly the code is coming together. I've written the background task and updated my view. The basic structure is there, but I haven't done the work of parsing the request or any error handling, so let's move on to that.</p>
<pre><code># ---- tasks.py ----
@shared_task
def send_email(user, subject, message_text):
    email.send(user.email, subject, text=message_text)

# ---- views.py ----
class MassEmailView(APIView)
    @authentication_classes((SessionAuthetication,))
    @permission_classes((IsAdmin,))
    def post(self, request):
        try:
            users = [
                User.objects.get(username=username)
                for username in request.POST['users'].split(',')
            ]
        except ObjectDoesNotExist:
            return Response(INVALID_USER_RESPONSE, status=400)

        subject = request.POST['message_text']
        text = request.POST['message_text']
        for user in users:
            tasks.send_email.delay(user, subject, text)
        return Response(None, status=200)
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we're done, it's clear that the <code>TODO</code> comments were hiding quite a bit of complexity, but the overall structure is the same. Just because our code is read by the computer from top to bottom doesn't mean we have to write it that way. Sometimes it helps to start with a rough outline of the whole picture, and slowly color it in bit by bit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What were the factors that tipped the competetive advantage away from [hunting-gathering] and towards [farming]? ...five main contributing factors can still be identified; the controversies revolve mainly around their relative importance.</p>
<p>One factor is the decline in the availability of wild foods. The lifestyle of hunter-gatherers has become increasingly less rewarding over the past 13,000 years, as resources on which they depended have become less abundant of even disappeared... most large mammal species became extinct in North and South  America at the end of the Pleistocene, and some became extinct in Eurasia and Africa, either because of climate changes or because of the rise on skill and numbers of human hunters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never heard this part of the argument before: that humans may have turned to farming because of the lack of large, huntable animals after the last ice age. It's fascinating to consider that the recent set of the Earth's cycles of natural climate change have not only been more favorable for humans to develop farming and complex civilization, but that they may have also forced our hands in the first place.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="footnote">
<sup>1.</sup> And that man-made climate change could be the end of that same civilization.

A few of you might even be a little abhorred by the idea that a modern piece of software has even a line of XML running through it, but it's true.</p>
<h2>But it's XML!</h2>
<p>XMPP is an old standard these days, and I think it's safe to say that it's earned a reputation for being a very complex and stateful XML-based protocol. But XMPP has also had years of industry giants testing its limits and adding new and improved functionality to the spec. All of that means that the XMPP spec has tons of recommendations and countless extensions which can make it difficult to approach as a newbie, but it also means that nearly anything you need to do with XMPP has already been done.</p>
<p>In building <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com">Adventurer's Codex</a> we wanted to leverage as many server technologies as possible with as little custom logic as we could manage. Nobody on the team wanted to write chat or pubsub functionality, or handle scaling the system with multiple nodes, and we wanted the system to be built on open technologies that support the idea of a standards based Open Web and all of the inter-compatibility that such a web entails. We looked around, and here was this perfectly good, time-tested standard just lying there, waiting for us.</p>
<p><a href="http://ejabberd.im">Ejabberd</a> has lots of great resources and chat rooms out there filled with people that can help you and the majority of commonly used specs like <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html">Multi-User Chat</a> and <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html">PubSub</a> are very well documented. The server software is robust and adaptable, and the defaults are already pretty good at getting you up and running. Perhaps most importantly, the client-side support for XMPP is really good: The web has <a href="http://strophe.im">Strophe.js</a> and all of the native platforms have either built in support or a wealth of Open Source options for speaking XMPP, so expanding support is easy. All of these things came together to make XMPP a worthwhile choice for our needs... even if it's XML.</p>", "date_published": "2017-07-11T13:12:00", "title": "Adventurer's Codex: XMPP", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/adventurers-codex-xmpp/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/adventurers-codex-the-stack/", "tags": ["adventurerscodex", "dnd", "software"], "content_html": "<p>I figure that if I'm going to write a series of posts about how and why <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com">Adventurer's Codex</a> works the way it does, it might be good to first talk about what's actually powering it. It's time to talk about our "stack".</p>
<p>People like to think that a project's internal technologies are chosen by seasoned professionals who carefully weighed the differences between competing options over the course of months, but from what I've seen it's usually just whatever the first developers on the project liked or already knew how to use and <a href="https://adventurerscodex.com">Adventurer's Codex</a> is no different. Before we started we asked around for suggestions on frameworks to use, and when in doubt we used what we'd learned at work. We were not seasoned architects and we didn't spend months deciding, we were (are) anxious developers trying to bring our dream to life.</p>
<h2>The Stack</h2>
<p>On the client-side, we went with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">KnockoutJS</a><sup>1</sup> and a ton of additional libraries. The trouble with the front-end world is that you essentially have to build up your own OS in the browser. Need notifications, persistence, url parsing, OAuth compatibility, or master-detail view hierarchies? Either you find one, or you build one. In our case, we built a lot. Why we chose to build out so many of our own custom libraries is a story for another time, but we do try to use existing libraries, like <a href="https://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals">Signals.js</a>, <a href="http://strophe.im">Strophe.js</a>, and more as often as we can. But when it came to a few crucial things like Persistence and MVC structure, we went our own way.</p>
<p>The server-side came a lot later in the timeline<sup>2</sup>, and collectively we have far more experience with the kinds of tech involved. We took the Marco Arment strategy: use the most boring, proven software you can find. We went with <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org">Django REST</a>, <a href="http://gunicorn-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Gunicorn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy">Nginx</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">Postgres</a>, and <a href="http://ejabberd.im">Ejabberd</a>, all  inside of <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>, on <a href="https://www.centos.org">CentOS</a>, on <a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a>. Nothing exciting there (except arguably Django REST) which is good.</p>
<p>Of course, if I could go back in time, there's a <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">few things I'd change about our client-side tech stack</a>, but knowing what we did back then, I think we made decent choices.</p>
