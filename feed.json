My answer in short: I kept adding features.</p>\n<p>Pine.blog 1.2 is a huge update, and it was intended to be, but as time went on it kept getting bigger mostly because I kept wanting \"just one more feature\". On the web side, I've improved the performance, finished most of the groundwork for the public API, added lots of tests to ensure I'm not accidentally breaking things, and added a 7-day free trial for new users. On the iOS side I've added the ability to follow and unfollow sites directly from the app, recommend sites to other users, browse a site's previous posts, you can now post to your own site, and there's a new Search/Discover tab with a browsable directory of new and interesting sites to follow. All in all, version 1.2 has probably 2-3 times as many features as the 1.1 version does, and I can say that v1.2 is at a point now where it has most of the features I originally envisioned for Pine.blog.</p>\n<p>With all that though, I'm not sure if it's a better strategy to release a steady stream of minor updates or hold things back for a few big releases every couple months. The same work gets done, but the steady stream means that more features would be released sooner instead of being held back for a major release. On the flip side though, its a lot harder to promote and get people excited about a minor release than a major one. And even if one approach is better than the other, I'll probably still find myself tacking on \"just one more thing\" into every release (I guess the hard part is limiting myself to just one \"just one more thing\").</p>\n<p>Regardless, I'm super excited to get v1.2 out into the world, so keep a weather eye on the horizon.</p>", "date_published": "2018-10-06T20:34:00-08:00", "title": "The Scope Creep is Real", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/the-scope-creep-is-real/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/pine-v11-is-out-amp-a-special-moment/", "tags": ["indie", "app development", "fracture"], "content_html": "<p>Pine <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pine-blog/id1401683628?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">v1.1 for iOS</a> is out today! This release ended up being a bit smaller than I'd originally intended, but it has enough fixes and improvements that I didn't want to sit on it any longer. Along with a few bug fixes and performance enhancements, Version 1.1 adds a couple of really cool features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Images now show up in a beautiful slideshow in the timeline, rather than just in the full post view.</li>\n<li>Siri can now read the contents of an article to you, which is really nice for keeping up with the news on a walk or ride.</li>\n<li>If a feed doesn't specify an image, Pine will grab the site's App Icon, or Favicon to show instead.</li>\n<li>Fixes a nasty issue that would cause scrolling to be really choppy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sign up for a <a href=\"https://pine.blog\">Pine.blog</a> subscription to start using the app today!</p>\n<h2>Pine Joins the Wall of Apps</h2>\n<p>On an episode of <a href=\"http://atp.fm\">ATP</a> years back, Marco Arment mentioned that he gets prints of his app icons made in order to have a physical reminder of what he's built.

What rules would you set such that it would urge us to be a better version of ourselves, not a worse version?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Their discussion really resonated with me. Jaron mentioned that he thinks that the algorithmic nature of today's social media and the algorithms used in advertising are both large causes of a lot of the strife we see online. He argues <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+F_9G-Gkus/30:58\">that how we measure engagement</a> (clicks, posts, activity, etc) allows  the most impassioned people (and often the most hateful) to drive the conversation.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking a lot about what makes good social media recently because of <a href=\"https://pine.blog\">Pine</a>. I think that a new generation of social media will revolve around the principles that users have control over what they see, that they own the content they post, and that no one person or company controls all the ways they see the world.

But, looking back on it today, I'd actually argue that RSS and Feeds as a whole never really disappeared, only the Feed Readers did.</p>\n<p>In building <a href=\"https://pine.blog\">Pine</a>, and as a long time Feed Reader user, I've been pleasantly surprised over these last 5 years to see that most sites still have RSS feeds. Sure, Facebook and Twitter don't support them, but YouTube, Reddit, Squarespace, Wordpress and so many more do by default.</p>\n<p>Feeds of all kinds still exist, nearly forgotten, in the markup of most websites, and this means that Feed Readers can, and will, make a comeback someday. The foundations are already laid; the hard work is done. RSS Feeds became a standard, and were built into the tools we use to make the web today. It's almost as if we laid the tracks and built the trains for a trans-continental railroad, but we've just forgotten how to sell tickets.</p>\n<p>What we're waiting for now is a resurgence and a new interpretation of what a Feed Reader can or should be. Sites like <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> focus heavily on building a social network of readers and microbloggers, while <a href=\"https://pine.blog\">Pine</a> focuses on discovering new and exciting people and sites to follow and new ways to interact with them, and <a href=\"http://rivernewsapp.com\">RiverNews</a> is a more traditional reader.</p>\n<p>Others have said this, but I think it's more true by the day: the Feed Readers, they're coming back.</p>", "date_published": "2018-07-06T23:39:00-08:00", "title": "RSS Has Already Won", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/rss-has-already-won/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/pine-for-ios-released/", "tags": ["pine", "ios", "app", "release"], "content_html": "<div class=\"image-container\">\n<img\n    src=\"/images/blog/pine/pine-app-logo-light.png\"\n    alt=\"Pine.blog iOS App Logo\"\n    style=\"max-width:150px; width:80%; box-shadow:3px 3px 5px darkgrey; border-radius:30px; padding:0; margin-right:10px; float:right;\"\n/>\n</div>\n\n<p>It's official: the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pine-blog/id1401683628?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Pine.blog app for iOS</a> is available on the App Store!

I've been developing Pine, in addition to a bunch of other projects for a while now, and it's finally time to show it off to the world.</p>\n<p>In a classical sense, Pine is a Feed Reader, but it's really more of a successor to my old <a href=\"/archive/microblogger-status-updates-and-more/\">Microblogger project</a> from way back. Not only can users follow the people and sites they want, but you can also use Pine to post to your own Wordpress site and find new sites and people using the built in search. In a lot of ways Pine and <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> are similar with a few key differences and, from what I can tell, both Manton and I started working on them at around the same time. Pine is my contribution to a new ecosystem of open social networking tools and services. Anyone on Micro.blog can follow people on Pine and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Pine is also my first venture into building paid software. It's $5 per month and at that price I don't have to sell ads or do anything shady to earn money.</p>\n<p>I've been reluctant to post anything about Pine until it officially launched, but now that it has, I've got a few interesting design decisions I'd like to talk about. Building a feed reader has always been on my to-do list, and it turns out that there's a lot more to it than just parsing feeds.</p>\n<p>I've got a lot of great new features planned, including an iOS app which should be coming soon. If you're interested, give Pine a shot, and let me know what you think!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pine.blog\">Pine &#8594;</a></p>", "date_published": "2018-05-23T11:30:00-08:00", "title": "Announcing Pine: Microblogging for a New Generation ðŸŽ‰", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/announcing-pine-microblogging-for-a-new-generation-/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/the-people-vs-democracy/", "tags": ["democracy", "politics", "technology"], "content_html": "<p>I just finished <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/People-vs-Democracy-Freedom-Danger/dp/0674976827/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526762388&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+people+vs+democracy\">Yascha Mounk's excellent book <em>The People vs. Democracy</em></a>. In it Yascha talks about how the two main parts of a Liberal Democracy are now at odds with each other, not working together.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>A <em>democracy</em> is a set of binding electoral institutions that effectively translate popular views into public policy.</li>\n<li><em>Liberal</em> institutions effectively protect the rule of law and guarantee individual rights such as freedom of speech, worship, press, and association to all citizens (including ethnic and religious minorities).</li>\n<li>A <em>liberal democracy</em> is simply a political system that is both liberal and democratic &mdash; one that both protects individual rights and translates popular views into public policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...Democracies can be illiberal...[especially] where most people favor subordinating independent institutions...or curtailing the rights of minorities they dislike. Conversely, liberal rÃ©gimes can be undemocratic, despite having regular competitive elections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've been thinking a lot about that distinction lately. Democracy is kind of a holy word in our society, a thing that cannot be bad, but as Yascha points out, the original democracy in Athens was known for executing writers and philosophers, and not extending suffrage past its male elites. It's the combination of Enlightenment era liberalism and democracy that gives us the systems we see around us today. Yascha's main point is that this combination seems to be falling apart all over the world as systems either become less democratic, or less liberal, or both at the same time.</p>\n<p>Yascha also dives into the possible causes of this split, and how to fix it; from social media to housing prices. It's a fascinating read, and it really changed the way I think about today's political climate for the better.

That being said, as a developer, I've had a pretty difficult time building features that rely on WebSockets because it's kind of annoying to see exactly what is being sent and received over the connection. I know that Chrome has some features to help with developing WebSocket applications, but I've never had a good experience with them, and I use Safari as my default browser for both casual use and for web development.</p>\n<p>That said, I stumbled across a new WebSocket Stream View in Safari's Dev Tools and, just like when <a href=\"/archive/gits-hidden-feature-notes/\">I discovered that Git supports notes</a>, I got really excited.
