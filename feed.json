I also mentioned that <a href=\"https://pine.blog/\">Pine.blog</a> aims to solve all three of them at once.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pine.blog/\">Pine.blog</a> has a chronological, Twitter-like, unified timeline of posts from sites you follow.</li>\n<li>You can easily connect your Wordpress blog with <a href=\"https://pine.blog/\">Pine.blog</a> and post to your site from within the <a href=\"https://pine.blog/\">Pine.blog</a> app or the website.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://pine.blog/\">Pine.blog</a> directory makes it easy to browse and search for other sites to follow, and is free for anyone to use regardless of whether they use Pine.blog or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to search, most social networks have some sort of recommendation system that gives users suggestions for new people, sites, or channels to follow. Recommendation systems are notoriously difficult to make well, and even \"good\" ones are now being heavily scrutinized for causing the isolated echo chambers you find on most social networks. If blogging and feed readers are to make a comeback, then they have to have an answer to the search and recommendation systems that all social networks have. Pine.blog has one of those: Search.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, social networks rely on a recommendation system where some sort of machine learning algorithm looks at your interests and recommends things to you, but recommendation engines are often the source of the echo chamber trap that most users find themselves in. Apps and services like <a href=\"https://overcast.fm\">Overcast</a> use a pretty simple recommendation engine that simply shows you podcasts and episodes that your Twitter friends have recommended. While <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> is probably the most conservative about shelling out recommendations: their discover page is manually curated according to their community guidelines. This has the added benefit of being able to really control what kind of stuff gets promoted on the site, but it can be difficult to scale and it can't easily give users personalized recommendations.</p>\n<p>How present the recommendations are also changes their effectiveness. Overcast and Micro.blog strategically place their recommendations in spots you'd only see if you were already looking for new stuff to follow, rather than omnipresently in the home feed or in banners on the side.</p>\n<p>All of those systems have problems; all systems do. I don't want Pine.blog to have yet another echo chamber system, and I also want to promote oft-neglected forms of content like <a href=\"https://brianschrader.com/archive/feed-readers-and-local-news/\">local news outlets and investigative journalism</a>. This leaves me with a hybrid approach between Micro.blog editorial curation and Overcast's friend-based recommendations. I'm pretty far off from building this system now, but when I do get to it, I want to make sure I've thought about the consequences first.</p>", "date_published": "2018-11-04T18:16:00-08:00", "title": "Recommendations, Echo Chambers, and Pine.blog", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/recommendations-echo-chambers-and-pineblog/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/blogging-has-an-image-problem/", "tags": ["blogging", "open web"], "content_html": "<p>I've asked a few people recently about the differences between services like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and traditional blogs. The answers are almost entirely conventional not technical, and this leads me to what I think is a big reason why blogging has receded in recent years: blogging has an image problem. It's supposed to be for everyone, but lots of people, who are sometimes extremely active on social media sites, are hesitant to start a blog.</p>\n<p>From a technical standpoint, the combination of a blog (that supports WebMentions and/or ActivityPub) and a good Feed Reader can provide nearly all of the features people require from a modern social network (a combination that <a href=\"https://pine.blog/\">Pine.blog</a> aims to provide). The technology exists, but to get started with blogging is still too complex. On Facebook or Twitter you can sign up and be posting in minutes, you can easily find other things to follow, and you can easily see what others are saying. Typical Feed Readers solve only one of these problems. You can follow other sites, but you can't post to your own, and you can't easily discover new sites to follow. Having a blog then means that you have to switch from reading a post in one app, to posting to your own blog in another, which makes blogging feel arcane and clunky. And even with both a good reader and a blog, it's still fairly difficult to find interesting things to follow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pine.blog/\">Pine.blog</a> is my attempt to solve all three of these issues at once and make reading blogs and blogging on your own site just as easy as browsing your timeline and posting to Twitter.</p>", "date_published": "2018-11-03T00:02:00-08:00", "title": "Blogging has an Image Problem", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/blogging-has-an-image-problem/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/feed-readers-and-local-news/", "tags": ["pine.blog", "local news"], "content_html": "<p>Interest in local news outlets has been declining over time.

My answer in short: I kept adding features.</p>\n<p>Pine.blog 1.2 is a huge update, and it was intended to be, but as time went on it kept getting bigger mostly because I kept wanting \"just one more feature\". On the web side, I've improved the performance, finished most of the groundwork for the public API, added lots of tests to ensure I'm not accidentally breaking things, and added a 7-day free trial for new users. On the iOS side I've added the ability to follow and unfollow sites directly from the app, recommend sites to other users, browse a site's previous posts, you can now post to your own site, and there's a new Search/Discover tab with a browsable directory of new and interesting sites to follow. All in all, version 1.2 has probably 2-3 times as many features as the 1.1 version does, and I can say that v1.2 is at a point now where it has most of the features I originally envisioned for Pine.blog.</p>\n<p>With all that though, I'm not sure if it's a better strategy to release a steady stream of minor updates or hold things back for a few big releases every couple months. The same work gets done, but the steady stream means that more features would be released sooner instead of being held back for a major release. On the flip side though, its a lot harder to promote and get people excited about a minor release than a major one. And even if one approach is better than the other, I'll probably still find myself tacking on \"just one more thing\" into every release (I guess the hard part is limiting myself to just one \"just one more thing\").</p>\n<p>Regardless, I'm super excited to get v1.2 out into the world, so keep a weather eye on the horizon.</p>", "date_published": "2018-10-06T20:34:00-08:00", "title": "The Scope Creep is Real", "id": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/the-scope-creep-is-real/"}, {"author": {"name": "Brian Schrader"}, "url": "http://brianschrader.com/archive/pine-v11-is-out-amp-a-special-moment/", "tags": ["indie", "app development", "fracture"], "content_html": "<p>Pine <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pine-blog/id1401683628?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">v1.1 for iOS</a> is out today!
