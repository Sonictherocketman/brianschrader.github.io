			<p>Twitter, we need to talk. I've been thinking, and I don't think our relationship is working out. You're not the social network I fell in love with anymore, you've changed.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, our relationship was so simple: I would follow people, and you would show me their posts in a simple, reverse-chronological timeline. You would recommend new people to follow, based on my habits, and people would follow me, starting the process all over again. The summer of 2012, for us, was the best summer of my life.</p>
<p>Recently though, you've changed. When you came home talking about your new makeover, something you called <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-character-limit-idUSKBN0UJ1S220160105">10k tweets</a>, it was a wakeup call for me. It was a small thing, but it was the last straw. We've been through some tough times together: I was there through the broken search era, the moments fiasco, and the great timeline reorganization. Those were dark times, but I stayed with you. You were different, you didn't try to manipulate me like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com">ex-who-shall-not-be-named</a>. You let me be me, and I loved you for it.</p>
<p>I loved you, even with all your faults, maybe even in spite of them. I loved that DMs have pretty much always been broken, and that your blocking system has always been half-assed. Your faults are what make you unique. Others laughed at us, but I ignored them because they didn't have what we had.</p>
<p>We saw the world together. We watched the world cheer when <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/22/lady-gaga-sound-of-music-oscars_n_6712612.html">Lady Gaga sang The Sound of Music</a>, we cried together when <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/">the news of events in Ferguson broke</a>, we laid in bed together laughing at <a href="https://twitter.com/justicar/status/661759505978429440">comics of Admiral Akbar</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/424279529218007040">stupid pictures of salads</a>. You were there for me, during my <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicrocketman/status/338809057345433600">stupid pictures</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicrocketman/status/339928142695251970">of a fedora</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicrocketman/status/338529457373593601">in random places</a> phase; those were dark times. Our love was tested, but we came out of it stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>We've had so many great times together, but I can't keep pretending that everything's ok. I depend on you, like so many others do, for realtime communication, and when you came back from that weekend Social Network's Spirit Quest in that WigWam in Arizona, <a href="/archive/chris-radcliff-on-twitters-timeline-changes/">you almost lost me</a>. You said that you'd <a href="http://globalspin.com/2014/09/communication-news-entertainment/">"rediscovered yourself" and that you were making changes for the better</a>. I tried to talk to you, <em>we all</em> tried to talk to you. We wanted you to go back to your roots, but you were converted by the teachings of Guru Facebook. </p>
<p>I can't keep pretending that we're still happy together. I loved what we were, but not what we are. And so, I'm leaving. Sure, I'll still visit every once and a while, but I think we should start seeing other people. I have to do a little "rediscovering" of my own. I need a social network that respects me, that doesn't reorder my messages because it knows better, or renames "Favorites" to "Likes" in order to desperately cling to the idea of being hip. I want a network that respects developers, and doesn't drive them away. I'm at a point in my life where I want a service that knows what it is, and what it wants. </p>
<p>I guess I'm saying that you've changed. You're driving your friends away, and now you've driven me away too. Sorry to say it out loud, but it's true, and so I'm leaving.</p>
<p>It's not me; it's you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of concrete naming makes this class's responsiblities grow endlessly. What functions should go in a view model? Nobody knows! Just do whatever.</p>
<p>The most charitable thing that I can say about this pattern is that <strong>it changes your kitchen sink from a view controller</strong>, which is not an object that you own (because it's a subclass of an Apple class), to a view model, an object that you do own. The view controller is now free to focus on view-lifecycle events, and is simpler for it. <strong>Still, though, we have a kitchen sink. It's just been moved</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my current projects is a Knockout MVVM project and I agree with everything Soroush is saying. We've pretty much decided that we are just going to use good-old MVC for our project instead of MVVM because of it's needless complexity. I'm reminded of a Gary Berndhart talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkzNHF6rMs"><em>Boundaries</em></a> in which he talks about the Ruby community's struggle with where to put their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">big balls of mud</a>.</p>

			<p>First off, I'd like to take a second to recommend a fantastic podcast by <a href="https://twitter.com/byzantiumcast">Robin Pierson</a>, <a href="http://thehistoryofbyzantium.com"><em>The History of Byzantium</em></a>. If you've ever heard of it, <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeduncan">Mike Duncan's</a> famous podcast, <a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com"><em>The History of Rome</em></a>, then think of Robin's as the continuation of Mike's work. THoR ended with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and THoB picks up right where Mike left off. It's an excellent podcast, and both are top contenders for my favorite podcasts ever. You should check them out.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" style="padding:10px;"
    src="/images/blog/thob.jpeg" /></p>
<p>I'm by no means caught up with the series. I'm on episode 43 and the series is, at time of writing, on episode 90. Regardless, I'd like to share a story that Robin told in episode 41 <a href="http://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2013/12/21/episode-41-who-is-a-byzantine/"><em>Who is a Byzantine</em></a> that blew me away.</p>
<p>We often think of the Romans and the Byzantines as two distinct empires, when in fact they were the same thing. The people of the Byzantine Empire called themselves Romans, and they called their empire Rome. Today, we think of the  Roman Empire as a thing long gone, but what's truly amazing is that it has only been 563 years since the fall of the empire. That may seem like a long time, but considering that the empire was around, in some form or another for 2,209 years(!), 500 isn't that long at all. Something that has been around for 2,000 years doesn't just vanish into the night, it leaves remnants that we can see even today, and I'm not talking about the stone monuments. The people who lived as Romans have not disappeared. This clip from episode 41 really hammers that home.</p>
<p><a href="../../audio/no_we_are_romans.mp3">Here's the audio clip &#8594;</a></p>
<p>An excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hellenism-Byzantium-Transformations-Reception-Classical/dp/0521876885">Anythony Kaldellis' book</a> summarized in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/tasios-kotakis/hellenism-in-byzantium-the-transformations-of-greek-identity-and-the-reception-o/232480986962419/">Facebook
post</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the island was occupied by the Greek navy, Greek soldiers were sent to the villages and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the children ran to see what these Greek soldiers, these Hellenes, looked like. "What are you looking at?" one of them asked. "At Hellenes," we replied. "Are you not Hellenes yourselves," he retorted. "No, we are Romans." [p.42]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What that means is that there are probably still people today who were born calling themselves Romans, 500 years after the empire collapsed, and that is  truly an amazing thought.</p>

		<div class="article-content">
			<p>Today, I removed Google Analytics from this site. I've been
debating this for a while now, ever since the <a href="/archive/re-the-ethics-of-modern-web-ad-blocking/">discussion of ad tracking that
came with the release of iOS 9</a>. I think it's unfair that I use Google 
Analytics to track visitors to this site but that I also block GA on my
machine.</p>
<p>During that whole discussion, I went looking for alternatives, and I've been
using <a href="http://goaccess.io">GoAccess</a> for a few months now in parallel with Google Analytics. 
Overall I'd say the results are vaguely comparable. GoAccess gives me higher 
overall numbers for pageviews and visitor counts, but that's a consequence of it
running on the server and seeing the effects of browser pre-fetching. </p>
<p><img alt="My reports" src="../../images/blog/_reports.png" /></p>
<p>Every night a custom script runs the numbers and spits out a directory with a 
few different reports for that day, and that week so far. It's a good system, 
and although it doesn't have the cool real-time features of Google Analytics, 
I found that that actually keeps me from constantly checking the traffic when 
I'm supposed to be doing something else. Although, GoAccess does have a live 
traffic CLI interface if I really need it.</p>
