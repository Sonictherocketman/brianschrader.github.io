			<p>In a recent talk, <a href="https://realm.io/news/slug-marcus-zarra-exploring-mvcn-swift/">Marcus Zarra</a> proposed a new addition to the
Model-View-Controller paradigm, which he calls the Network Controller (MVC-N):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a network controller: it talks to the internet, your local network,
or even be a flat file system. It then pushes data into your cache, into your
persistence engine. Here comes the exciting part: your entire view layer
talks to the cache only. It does not get data from the internet directly. The
ViewController’s job is to display or update that data, not to do networking
code.</p>
<p><em>Note: if you do not like the word “controller”, then “manager”, “handler”, or anything else works fine. The point is that it is a controller object, because it is not a view and not a model.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use this pattern all the time in my code, but I don't like calling it a
controller. I've started using the term <code>Service</code> to denote any class or set of
code that provides an abstraction for my View Controllers.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<p>In my code, I will typically have classes like <code>NetworkService</code>,
<code>DropboxService</code>, <code>ChatService</code>, <code>NotificationService</code>, etc. These services abstract their underlying protocols, data stores, and logic away from the View Controllers and allow for cleaner VC code.</p>
<p>I'm no where near as experienced in iOS development as Marcus is, but I like to
think of any Cocoa class that uses the <code>.shared()</code> or <code>.default()</code> paradigm as a built-in service.</p>
<pre><code class="c">
// This is a service. It abstracts the process of sending 
// notifications, and itself is not a view controller.
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter()
// So is this.
UIApplication.sharedApplication()
</code></pre>

<p>I've heard these kinds of classes called <code>Utility</code> classes, but I think that's
a big misnomer. Utility classes are little convenience
classes or functions that provide esoteric and unique functionality, while a
service abstracts some underlying, logically distinct functionality away from the View Controllers.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup> Services in this sense come from the Angular term for non-view
controller related logic that handles some background communication with the
network.

			<p>For a recent post, Rich Mogull talked with Apple about iMessage and security. I
always love to hear about cool engineering designs, and iMessage is
full them. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simplified overview of how iMessage security works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each device tied to your iCloud account generates its own public/private key
pair, and sends the public key to an Apple directory server. The private key
never leaves the device, and is protected by the device’s Data Protection
encryption scheme (the one getting all the attention lately).</li>
<li>When you send an iMessage, your device checks Apple’s directory server for the public keys of all the recipients (across all their devices) based on their
Apple ID (iCloud user ID) and phone number.</li>
<li>Your phone encrypts a copy of the message to each recipient device, using its
public key. I currently have five or six devices tied to my iCloud account,
which means if you send me a message, your phone actually creates five or six
copies, each encrypted with the public key for one device.</li>
<li>For you non-security readers, a public/private keypair means that if you
encrypt something with the public key, it can only be decrypted with the
private key (and vice-versa). I never share my private key, so I can make my
public key… very public. Then people can encrypt things which only I can read
using my public key, knowing nobody else has my private keys.</li>
<li>Apple’s Push Notification Service (APN) then sends each message to its
destination device.</li>
<li>If you have multiple devices, you also encrypt and send copies to all your own devices, so each shows what you sent in the thread.</li>
</ul>

			<p>This being an election year in the U.S., I've had a lot of conversations with friends and coworkers about various parts of the political process, voting, and of course the candidates. During these conversations I inevitably mention some point from CGP Grey's fantastic voting systems videos. If you haven't seen them already (links below), Grey explains how some of the weird quirks and pitfalls in our modern political systems are actually not at all related to the representatives or candidates, but to the underlying method that we use to elect them.</p>
<p>Politics and Law are always interesting because their results are so heavily
influenced by the way they are developed and enacted. The legal system, for example is not about the specific intent of any given law, but about how that law can be used to enact future laws and the precedent it sets. Politics works in the same way: The method we use to elect our officials affects how the officials run for office and what issues they bring up. The voting system is the lens through which we see and conduct our democracy, and, like every lens, it's not perfect.</p>

			<p><a href="http://buytaert.net/can-we-save-the-open-web">Dries Buytaert</a> on the dominance of large corporations and their algorithms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he internet has changed drastically over the last decade. It's become a more closed web. Rather than a decentralized and open landscape, many people today primarily interact with a handful of large platform companies online, such as Google or Facebook. To many users, Facebook and Google aren't part of the internet -- they are the internet.</p>
<p>According to a recent study from the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, information displayed in Google could shift voting preferences for undecided voters by 20 percent or more -- all without their knowledge...</p>
<p>It's possible that we're reaching the point where we need oversight for consumer-facing algorithms. Perhaps it's time to consider creating an oversight committee. Similar to how the FDA monitors the quality and safety of food and drugs, this regulatory body could audit algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just my initial thoughts, but I like the idea of having some agency oversee these large corporate algorithms. They play such a huge roll in our lives, and there's a large incentive for companies to manipulate their users to their own benefit. Facebook and Google especially have proven that they can do this extremely effectively, and like Dries' says, "without their knowledge". If we're going to allow these kinds of algorithms to be such a huge part of our lives, which I don't believe is necessarily a bad thing, then they should at least be subject to some sort oversight. At the very least, we could enforce a sort of <a href="/archive/software-engineering/">Programmer's Hypocratic Oath</a> or something.</p>
