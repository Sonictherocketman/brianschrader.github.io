					FBI tells Apple to Create a Master Key to iOS

			<p>This has been an interesting morning. Earlier today, Apple released a statement basically claiming that the FBI asked it to create an insecure version of iOS that would allow them to gain access to the data on a person's iPhone. They claim that they want this power to help their investigation of the San Bernardino case, but as many people have pointed out, this is not just about this one case, and it sets a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">Tim Cook (via mjtsai)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the FBI has requested data that’s in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and we’ve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal.</p>
<p>We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to note: Apple hasn't just given the FBI the information they need, but they've also provided them with engineers to advise them. From the post, it seems like Apple has been more than helpful to the FBI during this case, and now the FBI wants even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://marco.org/2016/02/17/not-about-this-5c">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s their excuse to establish precedent and permanent backdoors for themselves so they can illegally spy on anyone’s data whenever they please. They’re shamelessly using a horrible tragedy to get themselves more power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after Apple released this statement, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/eff-support-apple-encryption-battle">EFF said that they will file in support of Apple</a>. I hope that their support will help Apple convince the government that this is a bad idea, but unfortunately I don't think it's going to do any good.</p>

					Better Image Sharing with Dropbox

			<p>I share a lot of pictures and even more screenshots. Until now, I've been using Dropbox's built-in "Share Screen Shots" feature. It's super convenient because it captures the screenshots automatically and puts a Dropbox link in your clipboard. It might sound silly, but once you've gotten used to it, there's no going back.</p>
<p><img alt="Dropbox screen share" src="../../images/blog/dropbox_ss.png" /></p>
<h2>What's Wrong?</h2>
<p>There are a number of problems with sharing these links over social media. If you aren't logged into Dropbox, it put's up a lovely sign-up form instead of the picture, many apps can't show the image inline because they don't know how to scrape the Dropbox page, and the page can sometimes be extremely slow to load. It's super convenient for the poster, but not for the reader.</p>
<p><img alt="Before and after" src="../../images/blog/tw_ss.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Enter Alfred</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred is an awesome Mac utility</a> that, among other things, replaces the default Spotlight search. It's other main function is managing custom keyboard macros. After <a href="/archive/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/">my switch</a> to <a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a> for microblogging, I needed a new way to share images. Snippets doesn't host images for you like Twitter does, and I didn't want to put the images on imgur or some other service, so I fired up Alfred, and got to work.</p>
<p><img alt="My Macro" src="../../images/blog/alfred.jp2" /></p>
<p>I now have a simple 2 step macro that takes any Dropbox link and converts it to the raw file URL, and puts it in the clipboard. The only downside is that my screenshot-sharing-workflow is now 2 keystrokes instead of 1, but that's something I think I can live with.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cphwp7brw14r0lo/Convert%20Dropbox%20Share%20Link%20to%20Raw%20Image%20URL.alfredworkflow?dl=0">Here's the Alfred Workflow if you want to try it &#8594;</a></p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1</sup> <small>But now I can convert <em>any</em> Dropbox share link to it's raw form, not just images. So I guess it's a net positive.</small></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 750 BC and 400 BC, the Ancient Greeks composed songs meant to be accompanied by the lyre, reed-pipes, and various percussion instruments. More than 2,000 years later, modern scholars have finally figured out how to reconstruct and perform these songs with (it’s claimed) 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>Really cool.</p>

			<p>Text files are really small, and blog posts are just text files. Web pages are getting bigger and bigger over time. <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">Maciej Cegłowski</a> calls it the "The Website Obesity Crisis" (and you should watch his talk). In response to this, I've removed some assets from this site that I wasn't using. Individual articles are now ~12KB plus images, as they should be. </p>

			<p>Well, I finally did it; I finally upgraded this site to use https. I've wanted to do this for a while, and I know that I should have done it years ago, but the thought of having to upgrade Apache, even after all these years, still puts a chill down my spine. Regardless, this site is now certified by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, and my thanks to them for making free SSL certificates a possibility. </p>
<p>I encountered a few troubles while upgrading, and I hope no one noticed, but for anyone looking to do the same thing, here's a few links that helped me through the process:</p>
