<p>I explained how MP3s work, and why this is a problem, on Accidental Tech Podcast last week...</p>
<p>See for yourself: here’s that same podcast in VBR. Note that the file is 25% smaller and the theme song (at 1:22:47 in the original file) sounds way nicer in the VBR version. But if you seek to the same timestamp as the above share link — 1:24:30 — you’ll hear the wrong audio. The player will say 1:24:30, but you’re actually hearing the audio at 1:25:16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post is direct follow up to his <a href="https://overcast.fm/+CdTym-vo/1:23:49">really awesome discussion on ATP</a> this week about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_bitrate">Variable BitRate (VBR)</a> MP3s and why they're more space-efficient, better sounding, and yet no one uses them. It's a really interesting topic, and as usual, Marco does a great job illustrating the problem and the many possible solutions.</p>
<p>As with so many things in software, the solutions are rarely limited by technology, they're limited by the standards we use (or don't use).</p>

			<p>I really like <a href="http://www.tabletopaudio.com">Tabletop Audio</a>. It's a great tool for anyone who's running a Tabletop RPG, or for writers who're looking for atmospheric background music. There's lots of different genres represented (much more than typical fantasy stuff). I've been using the site for a while, but I just discovered the new SoundPad feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SoundPad was designed for those of you who wanted more control over your sonic environments. Instead of fire-and-forget 10 minute ambiences, each SoundPad is made up of a few dozen sounds, divided into categories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've spent a bit of time today playing with SoundPad, and it's really cool. Instead of hunting for just the right atmospheric music, or just defaulting to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-original/id596951310">Skyrim soundtrack</a>, I can tweak and tune the music, and sound-effects in the game. One of the coolest features of SoundPads, and playlists, is the ability to send live links to the music/sounds you're mixing.</p>

			<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://sourcemaking.com">Source Making</a>, you should check them out. They
have a lot of really great and simple tips and tricks to help developers write
good code and refactor bad code, and they have lots of practical examples for
each of their techniques.</p>
<p>Here's two of my favorite tips: </p>
<p><a href="https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism">Replace Conditional with Polymorphism</a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This technique adheres to the Tell-Don't-Ask principle: instead of asking an
object about its state and then performing actions based on this, it is much
easier to simply tell the object what it needs to do and let it decide for
itself how to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removes duplicate code. You get rid of many almost identical conditionals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to add a new execution variant, all you need to do is add a new
subclass without touching the existing code (Open/Closed Principle). </p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses">Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>
You have a group of nested conditionals and it is hard to determine the normal
flow of code execution.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Isolate all special checks and edge cases into separate clauses and place them
before the main checks. Ideally, you should have a "flat" list of conditionals,
one after the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to the first tip, I find myself falling into the trap of if/elsing
though a list of cases just to determine what to do next, or what state to
alter. Unfortunately, a lot of Python libraries are guilty of this practice. 
Replacing each of the cases with concrete subclasses would definitely help 
developers keep track of the various code paths, all while making the code cleaner. </p>
<p>In keeping with the second tip, one of my favorite features of Swift is its <a href="https://thatthinginswift.com/guard-statement-swift/">Guard</a> statement. It keeps the normal execution logic clean, while still allowing the developer to handle rare, or extraordinary cases easily. </p>

			<p>Earlier this week I wrote up a simple script to strip out links in log files 
and add them to an RSS feed. Up till now I've been having it monitor a few

<p>The script can parse most generic log formats, but by default it only parses

			<p>Editing is difficult; especially difficult when it's your own work.
Professional writers will often advise reading your writing aloud. This helps
you find errors with narrative flow, voice, and sentence structure, but I'm
usually writing in public (i.e. at a coffee shop), so that's not normally an
option. </p>
<p>Siri is a great editing tool, and now I can't imagine writing a
post with out it. When a blog post is in the editing
phase, I'll plug in some headphones and listen to Siri read the post to me. The
first time I'll listen intently, and fix glaring flaws. Each time afterward, I
listen less and less attentively, only fixing what pops out at me. Sometimes I'll even go for a walk while I listen. Being outside and moving around seems to help me untangle particularly pesky prose.</p>
<p>Hearing your wording aloud and with someone else's voice, inflection, and tone can really help you fine tune things like punctuation, voice, and structure. Generally, with Siri, my writing is better, clearer, cleaner, and more concise.</p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup> A great side-effect of using Siri to edit your writing is
that you'll actually know what it sounds like to people who use Siri for
Accessibility reasons. This can help you find and eliminate HTML artifacts or
missing alt-text.

			<p>There's been a lot of talk lately about Swift's relationship with dynamic runtime features. Since I've been developing in Swift for almost two months, I'm perfectly qualified to comment on it in depth, and that's what I'm now going to do (sorry).</p>
<p>First off, I like Swift's syntax a lot. Trailing closures are a thing
I didn't know I needed, and while I have a few nitpicks about the language,
overall I'm really enjoying using it.<sup>1</sup> That said, I've found myself
adopting a few strange habits when writing Swift that I'm not sure are good best
practices, but they do seem to be the way that Apple wants Swift to be written. The biggest offender, and my least favorite feature: <code>switch-case</code> statements.</p>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/05/25/oldie_complains_about_the_old_old_ways">Brent Simmons:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In the old days] There were lots of switch statements. To add, for instance, a copy (or
whatever) implementation to a particular view, you’d have to edit your event
dispatcher to know about that particular view and its copy function. Making
changes required making changes in various places. </p>
<p>- Oldie Complains About the Old Old Ways</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swift's <code>enums</code> are very powerful, but Apple's sample code uses them for so many things.<sup>2</sup> I've found myself <code>switch-case</code>-ing through <code>enums</code> in most of my ViewControllers. It not only looks ugly, but just feels wrong. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">Gary Bernhardt:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some apologists... [would say] that
it's the programmer's fault for using it in this way... My own view is that 
the behavior that you see a tool being used for is the behavior that that 
tool encourages.</p>
<p>- The Birth and Death of Javascript (~3:30) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brent, and many others, seem concerned about Swift's current relationship with
dynamic features. While I don't dismiss the "old guy complaining about the
new ways" effect, I never like to discount the opinions of long-time, seasoned platform developers. They've seen these kinds of things play out before. I haven't run into most of the other issues and concerns that Brent has brought up, but I have had to write more than a few <code>switch-case</code> statements, which is more than a few too many. </p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup> When Swift came out, it was a hardcore <a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/lbyl-vs-eafp/">LBYL</a> language. Now that it has <code>try</code> statements, the language feels confused. I don't know which is more "Swifty".
<br />
<sup>2</sup> In Python, the community has strong opinions about what's "Pythonic". The way Apple recommends developers write Swift will have a huge influence on what becomes the "Swifty" style.

					Python-like Context Managers in Swift

			<small style="font-style:italic;">Posted on Wed, 25 May 2016 at 03:25 PM </small>
		</div> <!-- End article-title -->
		<div class="article-content">
			<p>One of the most expressive concepts in Python is the context manager, and their
simplest use case is reading and writing files.</p>
<p><code class="python"><pre>
with open('path/to/my/file') as f:
    f.write(some_data)
</pre></code></p>
<p>All of the logic that handles opening the file, checking for errors, and
closing the file is handled automatically by the <code>with</code> statement. This allows
developers to write cleaner, more expressive code without worrying about the
nitty gritty details of opening/closing files, and Python allows you to write
your own context managers. This makes it easy to clean up any code that needs
to execute in a given, safe context.</p>
<h2>Enter Swift</h2>
<p>Swift doesn't have the concept of a context manager, but they can still be easily implemented using Swift's clean and clear closure syntax.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful use-cases for a context manager in Cocoa is in a custom view's <code>drawRect</code> function. CGContexts can get confusing
if you're having to deal with them yourself. If only we had some sort of
manager for these contexts. </p>
<pre><code class="swift">
// First let's define our context manager function.
func drawBlockInSafeContext(block: (context: CGContext?) -> ()) {
    let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()
    CGContextSaveGState(context)
    block(context: context)
    CGContextRestoreGState(context)
}
class MyView: UIView {
    //...
    func drawRect(rect: CGRect) {
        drawBlockInSafeContext { context in
            // Now we can draw our view 
            // without polluting the root context 
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Context Managers are one of my favorite features of Python and I'd love to see
the concept carried over to Swift. For the record: Omar Abdelhafith has a great tutorial on making more advanced, and more <a href="https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/swift-context-manager-implementing-python-context-manager-in-swift-f327b2b4a7d7#.oys53xm0u">Pythonic Swift Context
