<blockquote>
<p>Between 750 BC and 400 BC, the Ancient Greeks composed songs meant to be accompanied by the lyre, reed-pipes, and various percussion instruments. More than 2,000 years later, modern scholars have finally figured out how to reconstruct and perform these songs with (it’s claimed) 100% accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really cool.</p>

			<p>Text files are really small, and blog posts are just text files. Web pages are getting bigger and bigger over time. <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">Maciej Cegłowski</a> calls it the "The Website Obesity Crisis" (and you should watch his talk). In response to this, I've removed some assets from this site that I wasn't using. Individual articles are now ~12KB plus images, as they should be. </p>

			<p>Well, I finally did it; I finally upgraded this site to use https. I've wanted to do this for a while, and I know that I should have done it years ago, but the thought of having to upgrade Apache, even after all these years, still puts a chill down my spine. Regardless, this site is now certified by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, and my thanks to them for making free SSL certificates a possibility. </p>
<p>I encountered a few troubles while upgrading, and I hope no one noticed, but for anyone looking to do the same thing, here's a few links that helped me through the process:</p>

			<p>It's been <a href="/archive/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/">15 days now</a> since I unofficial-officially left Twitter, and I have a few thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>I'll admit, the first 3 days without Twitter <em>sucked</em>. I was constantly texting everyone I knew, trying to get them to convince me to go back, but to no avail. I wanted to constantly check up and read what people were posting, I wanted, and still want to take part in the bigger conversations that happen on Twitter. To be clear, I said that I would be leaving Twitter as my main platform, and I have, but I do still like to read Twitter, to check up on my friends, and I'm still replying to mentions and the like.</p>
<p>After the first week, I found myself wanting to check Twitter less, but I still wanted an outlet for my sparratic thoughts; enter <a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a>. I have a full <a href="http://sonicrocketman.snippets.xyz">microblog</a> there, and I it set up to cross-post to Twitter. Overall this system has been working great for me. I get the conversations from Twitter, and I'm in control of the content. </p>
<p><a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a> is still in beta, and I'm lucky to be a tester for it, but when it comes out, I'll be sure to let you all know. Since it's just a Jekyll blog though, you can follow it with any plain-old RSS reader (yay Open Web!).</p>
<p>I'm now treating Twitter like I have always treated Facebook: as a place to cross-post things, and respond to comments with the real content residing on my blog, as it should. </p>
<hr />
<p><small>P.S. Another thing I've noticed is that I have a lot more down time now that I'm not checking Twitter every 5 minutes.</small></p>

			<p>In keeping with the History theme, I want to share a few excerpts from Tim Urban's fantastic article, <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html">Horizontal History</a>, from the other day.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html">Tim Urban</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of us have a pretty terrible understanding of history. Our knowledge is spotty, with large gaps all over the place, and the parts of history we do end up knowing a lot about usually depend on the particular teachers, parents, books, articles, and movies we happen to come across in our lives.</p>
<p>I might know that Copernicus began writing his seminal work On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres in Poland in the early 1510s, but by learning that right around that same time in Italy, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, I get a better picture of the times. By learning that it was right while both of these things were happening that Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in England, the 1510s suddenly begins to take on a distinct personality. These three facts, when put together, allow me to see a more three-dimensional picture of the 1510s—it allows me to see the 1510s horizontally, like cutting out a complete segment of the vine tangle and examining it all together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tim put together an amazing (and huge) image of various historical figures and their relationship to each other. He makes a point in highlighting the fact that people we think of as living in isolated worlds, often worked, and lived around the same time (i.e. Charles Darwin, Mark Twain, Ghandi, Karl Marx, and Nietzsche).</p>
<p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg"><img alt="Horizontal History" src="/images/blog/horiz-history-1.jpg" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Darwin would have seen Twain as some young kid and he would have shaken his old man fist at Gandhi from the rocking chair on his porch. Meanwhile, Nietzsche would have seen Marx as a guy his dad’s age and Freud as a contemporary, though a bit younger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One section of the picture that I found super interesting, highlights the relationships between a few famous Romans. In this picture you can see the newly minted Roman Empire, with Augustus as it's first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps#Roman_Emperor">Princeps</a>, grow to it's greatest extend and power, through Trajan and Hadrian, and begin to fall apart, during the time of Marcus Aurelius. It's almost 200 years of history, but only 7 generations.</p>
