			<p>I really like <a href="http://www.tabletopaudio.com">Tabletop Audio</a>. It's a great tool for anyone who's running a Tabletop RPG, or for writers who're looking for atmospheric background music. There's lots of different genres represented (much more than typical fantasy stuff). I've been using the site for a while, but I just discovered the new SoundPad feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SoundPad was designed for those of you who wanted more control over your sonic environments. Instead of fire-and-forget 10 minute ambiences, each SoundPad is made up of a few dozen sounds, divided into categories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've spent a bit of time today playing with SoundPad, and it's really cool. Instead of hunting for just the right atmospheric music, or just defaulting to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-original/id596951310">Skyrim soundtrack</a>, I can tweak and tune the music, and sound-effects in the game. One of the coolest features of SoundPads, and playlists, is the ability to send live links to the music/sounds you're mixing.</p>

			<p>Once again <a href="https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/2016/07/29/forge-blower/">Primitive Tech</a> amazes me. If you haven't heard of this YouTube
channel, you should check it out (you should read his blog posts too). So far, 
he's mostly built huts (<a href="https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/building-a-hut-with-a-kiln-fired-tiled-roof-underfloor-heating-and-mud-pile-walls/">one even had a fireplace</a>) and primitive tools, but with the latest video, he's taken on building a furnace hot enough to smelt metal. It's super simple in concept, and looks pretty effective. </p>

			<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://sourcemaking.com">Source Making</a>, you should check them out. They
have a lot of really great and simple tips and tricks to help developers write
good code and refactor bad code, and they have lots of practical examples for
each of their techniques.</p>
<p>Here's two of my favorite tips: </p>
<p><a href="https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism">Replace Conditional with Polymorphism</a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This technique adheres to the Tell-Don't-Ask principle: instead of asking an
object about its state and then performing actions based on this, it is much
easier to simply tell the object what it needs to do and let it decide for
itself how to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removes duplicate code. You get rid of many almost identical conditionals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to add a new execution variant, all you need to do is add a new
subclass without touching the existing code (Open/Closed Principle). </p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses">Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>
You have a group of nested conditionals and it is hard to determine the normal
flow of code execution.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Isolate all special checks and edge cases into separate clauses and place them
before the main checks. Ideally, you should have a "flat" list of conditionals,
one after the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to the first tip, I find myself falling into the trap of if/elsing
though a list of cases just to determine what to do next, or what state to
alter. Unfortunately, a lot of Python libraries are guilty of this practice. 
Replacing each of the cases with concrete subclasses would definitely help 
developers keep track of the various code paths, all while making the code cleaner. </p>
<p>In keeping with the second tip, one of my favorite features of Swift is its <a href="https://thatthinginswift.com/guard-statement-swift/">Guard</a> statement. It keeps the normal execution logic clean, while still allowing the developer to handle rare, or extraordinary cases easily. </p>

			<p>Earlier this week I wrote up a simple script to strip out links in log files 
and add them to an RSS feed. Up till now I've been having it monitor a few 
IRC channels and pull out the links in real-time, but I have an idea to use 
this script as a sort of "instant link blogging" tool which I'll hopefully 
get going really soon. </p>
<p>The script can parse most generic log formats, but by default it only parses
<a href="https://textualapp.com">Textual's</a> logs. Currently the script has to be rerun to check for
changes, but that's going to be fixed (hopefully right after this post goes
up). </p>
<p>Check it out. It's <a href="https://github.com/Sonictherocketman/link-feed-generator">hosted, as usual, on GitHub &#8594;</a> </p>
