			<blockquote>
<p>Our tale starts as many such tales often do. It was the end of July in the year two-thousand and fifteen by western reckoning and three friends met in a busy tavern in a sleepy neighborhood in San Diego. Their quest: to change the way Dungeons and Dragons would be played forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost two years ago, I started a project with a few friends that last year we turned into a full-on company: <a href="//adventurerscodex.com/">Adventurer's Codex</a>. For no particular reason, I've never spoken about the project here, but I'm going to change that, if nothing but for posterity. Originally I wanted to write a single "What I've learned while building Adventurer's Codex" post, but it got too big and covered so many unrelated topics that I'm just going to have to make it into a series of smaller posts.</p>
<h2>A Codex, But For Adventurers!</h2>
<p>For those who don't know: Adventurer's Codex is a web-based toolset for playing 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D 5e). It has a number of features for both players and DMs (Dungeon Masters, aka Game Masters) with a focus on real-time, collaborative play. I've played D&amp;D for years, and so have the other two founders, and we all think that while the classic pen-and-paper version of D&amp;D is great, there are some definite improvements to be made.</p>
<p>If you're interested in <a href="//adventurerscodex.com/">seeing what Adventurer's Codex can do, checkout the site and try it out</a>, and if you don't know what D&amp;D is, or you've never played, then I strongly encourage you to try it.</p>
<h2>No Choice but to Rise to the Challenge</h2>
<p>Software design has always been interesting to me. I've spent countless hours learning about just how lots of mature projects, like CPython, Cocoa, and iOS, work at the high level, and how their designs limit or enhance their core features. So when it came down to designing Adventurer's Codex, I jumped at the chance. The only trouble was: I'd never actually designed anything so big before; none of us had. And so, like with many projects, the architecture for Adventurer's Codex grew as we did.</p>
<p>When we started, I had no idea how to professionally set up servers, design modern APIs, or design multi-tier web applications. I had this website, which I was proud of, and in-and-out of my day job I'd built lots of different types of web and native software. Coming from iOS/Cocoa and Java/Spring development at the time meant that I was always accustomed to having a very large, opinionated framework to guide the design of whatever I was building, but when it comes to front-end Javascript, that's just not the case. In the browser, we were forced/free to pick and choose our own tools, libraries, and conventions and because of this, we stumbled a lot in the early days: tearing through three different data storage strategies and three more major code architecture changes. Every one of these experiences taught us something about software design, but it also slowed us down, and nearly burnt me out, but all of that is (hopefully) behind us now.</p>
<p>Although getting this far has been a huge undertaking, because of the way we chose to develop Adventurer's Codex, we've been able to slowly roll out bits and pieces of infrastructure over almost a year while still having a working product. If I had to give advice for anyone in the same position: ask people who've done it before. A few invaluable people at my local programming meetup group had experience with all of the things I didn't and were more than happy to point me in the right direction. The internet is great, but it's actually pretty difficult to find out how to design modern web systems from scratch with just a vague notion and Google.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Turns out, designing, architecting, and managing complex software is hard...</p>

<p>It became clear after a while we were looking at chunks of uninitialized memory interspersed with valid data. The program that this uninitialized data was coming from just happened to have the data I wanted in memory at the time...</p>
<p>A while later, we figured out how to reproduce the problem. It looked like that if an html page hosted behind cloudflare had a specific combination of unbalanced tags, the proxy would intersperse pages of uninitialized memory into the output...</p>
<p>We fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major cloudflare-hosted sites from other users. Once we understood what we were seeing and the implications, we immediately stopped and contacted cloudflare security.</p>

<p>The crazy thing here is that the Project Zero people were joking last night about a disclosure that was going to keep everyone at work late today. And, this morning, Google announced the SHA-1 collision, which everyone (including the insiders who leaked that the SHA-1 collision was coming) thought was the big announcement.
Nope. A SHA-1 collision, it turns out, is the minor security news of the day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines. We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence...</p>
<p>We are grateful that it was found by one of the worldâ€™s top security research teams and reported to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This broke late last night PST, and while Travis Ormandy and the hardworking team at Cloudflare have resolved the situation, the consequences of this bug are not small. Cloudflare is a very large CDN that sits in front of tens of thousands of sites and all of them are potentially affected.</p>

			<p>A while back I got into the habit of adding links to any source code that I copy from the web. It's a small addition but it's helped me a lot when I need to go back and fix bugs long after I've forgotten what I did or why.</p>
<p><code class="swift"><pre>
// From: http://bit.ly/2ltsDF6
extension Data {
    /// Create hexadecimal string representation of <code>Data</code> object.
    ///
    /// - returns: <code>String</code> representation of this <code>Data</code> object.
    func hexadecimal() -&gt; String {
        return map { String(format: "%02x", $0) }
            .joined(separator: "")
    }
}
</pre></code></p>
<p>This technique is also really useful if you encounter unsupported or buggy behavior in some framework or library and you write a weird workaround or unconventional solution. In those cases I don't just document that it <em>is</em> a workaround, I try to link to a place that explains or tracks the bug (like the GitHub Issue or Stack Overflow page).</p>
<p><code class="swift"><pre>
switch identifier {
case "SpecialWaitStep", "OtherSpecialWaitStep":
    // Wait steps aren't backward navigable.
    // https://github.com/ResearchKit/ResearchKit/issues/914
    return nil
default:
    return getStep("...")
}
</pre></code></p>
<p>This way if anyone (future me included) needs to go back to fix that section of code, they'll at least know why that hack is there.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div class="footnote">
<sup>1.</sup> Hell, maybe by then the issue has been solved and they can even remove your hacky code.

			<p>I got my first Mac in 2010: A <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP583?locale=en_US">base model 13" Macbook Pro</a>. Like lots of people I got it in my first year of college with Apple's Education Discount. I had it all the way through college until 2015 when I got my current <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP715?locale=en_US">13" Retina Macbook Pro</a>. In that time, I'd dropped it, fixed it, swapped out the spinning platter for an SSD, added RAM, and made it my own. I learned to program on it, I played PC games with it, and <a href="/archive/writing-for-a-website-you-built-from-scratch/">I built this website with it</a>. I used every ounce of power that 2.4GHz Core2-Duo could spare.</p>
<p>In short: I loved that machine.</p>
<p>That Macbook Pro turned me into a Mac person. I justified buying it by saying that I'd build iPhone apps with it, but that never really came to pass. I did learn about Unix and Bash though, and that knowledge changed how I used computers forever. Back then I looked forward to 2 things every year: the new iPhone OS announcement and the Mac OS X announcement. I even took time off work one year to stay home and watch WWDC talks in a time before I'd ever worked on iOS apps professionally.</p>
<p>In short: I found what I wanted to do because of that Mac and it changed me forever.</p>
<p><img alt="My mac at a donut-shop in portland" src="/images/blog/doughnuts-and-chai.jpg" /></p>
<p>In 2015 I got my current Mac. When I passed on my old 2010 MBP it was dented, missing a foot, and had no CD drive (I took it out to save weight and then lost it). Fresh out of college I forked over literally all of the money I had for a specced out 13" rMBP. Two and a half years later I can say, it's the best computer I've ever owned or used. I've taken it everywhere, and it's risen to every challenge I've thrown at it (except modern PC gaming but I don't play a lot anyway).</p>
<p>Excluding a few months when I experimented with building PCs in college<sup>1</sup> and at my old day-job, my Macs have always been my primary and only machines, and now my 2015 rMBP is my work machine too. They've both been as flexible, durable, extensible, and powerful as I could ask.</p>
<h2>The Part About Apple Nowadays</h2>
<p>That long preamble was more than a nice stroll down memory lane. I may not have the pedigree of <a href="http://hypercritical.co">some mac users</a> but I love the Mac and over the years I've seen Apple seem to forget how much people love, use, and need the Mac to do what they do, and it makes me sad. Maybe they're working on something awesome for the Mac and I hope if they are that it's as great as it can be, but it doesn't look that way from the outside.</p>
<p>I could stand here and say that I wish the 13" MacBook Pro had dedicated graphics card and quad-core CPU options (and I <em>really</em> do wish that), but after 7 years I just don't see that happening. I guess what I want is something to prove that the Mac is still worth something to Apple. The Mac community is strong enough to last for years without Apple updating much, but that's not something I look forward to, it's a last resort.</p>
<h2>The Circle Be Unbroken</h2>
<p>Growing up, my mom had (and still has) a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4">17" Titanium Powerbook G4</a>, and she used it for almost 10 years, she was the first Mac user in the house, and though I used them in middle and high school I'd always had a Windows PC at home. In 2009 a coworker and long-time Mac user convinced my parents to get me an iPhone, and a few months later I bought my first Mac.</p>
<p>Since that time I've convinced my sister, several coworkers, friends, and many complete strangers to get Macs. I've always said the price was worth it, and even though I think that's less true now, I'd still recommend the Mac over the alternative. All of those people are using Macs today because some enthusiastic college student convinced them to get one, and he got his Mac and iPhone because of a passionate Mac user who convinced him back in 2010.</p>
<p>That old MacBook is till alive; it's my mom's laptop now. It's worked well for her until this year: she got a GoPro and needs to edit the video. That MacBook can do a lot of things, but rendering 1080p and 4K video comfortably isn't one of them. If and when she gets a new computer, I'll probably ask for that MacBook back. There's not much I can use it for, but just like my old iPhones, it'll be a nice thing to keep around for the memories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New state bills that would create a database firewall between California and the federal government passed out of their respective Senate committees on Tuesday. Both are headed to the Appropriations Committee and then could soon see votes by the full California Senate. If passed, these critical bills would help prevent Muslim registries and mass deportations in California and would send a strong message to the Trump administration that Californians will resist his attacks on digital liberty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is some much needed positive Government-related news. I have no idea how legal it is for California to directly oppose Trump's ideas, but I'm all for them. California is the most powerful state in the U.S. by economy and population; let's see what happens when that power gets put to use.</p>
<p>I don't know how much control California has over Silicon Valley companies and their databases, but those are arguably the most important stores of personal data in the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Importantly, these pro-privacy policies will outlast President Trump. Once baked into California law, theyâ€™ll safeguard the over 38 million residents of California for generations to come.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you remember how the web used to work? How the web was supposed to work?</p>
<p>In the earlier days of the web, we always published to our own web site. If you werenâ€™t happy with your web host, or they went out of business, you could move your files and your domain name, and nothing would break.</p>
<p>Today, most writing instead goes into a small number of centralized social networking sites, where you canâ€™t move your content, advertisements and fake news are everywhere, and if one of these sites fails, your content disappears from the internet. Too many sites have gone away and taken our posts and photos with them.</p>
<p>I want to encourage more independent writing. To do that, we need better tools that embrace microblogs and the advantages of the open web. We need to learn from the success and user experience of social networking, but applied to the full scope of the web.</p>

			<p>Like lots of passionate Mac users, I've been keeping tabs on the "State of the Mac" discussions in the last few months. I don't feel like I'm as disappointed as most in Apple's hardware, but I do think that macOS could use some real attention as some annoying bugs have slipped into the last few updates to my Mac. I'm still using El Capitan and liking it a lot, and my 2014 13" Retina Macbook Pro is still my favorite computer ever. Overall I'm happy with my setup, but Apple's future for the Mac still worries me.</p>

<p>I deeply value the consistency, versatility, reliability and integration of Mac OS X and the excellent quality hardware it runs on...</p>
<p>Of course even if I make the switch there are a number of possible drawbacks, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time required to find replacements for all the software I use.</li>
<li>The lack of equally high standard replacements for software...</li>
</ul>
<p>Elementary is stunning and definitely my favourite. It wonâ€™t appeal to everyone but their philosophies and direction really resonate with me. Specifically they have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human Interface Guidelines</li>
<li>A primary, native programming language (Vala, no Python and JS \o/).</li>
<li>A model for funding ongoing development (Bug bounties, Patreon, asking for payment when downloading).</li>
<li>Designers as well as developers on the team.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just casually looking at Elementary, I have to say I really like the look of it. If I was going to switch right now, which I'm certainly not, I would use Elementary. Actually if I ever want a nice Linux GUI for anything, I'd probably use Elementary.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The biggest switching cost for me is still the lack of comparable software on any other platform. The Mac's software ecosystem is fantastic (though a lot of people complain about how it could be so much more, it's still the best by a long shot). There just aren't alternatives for most of the fantastic software I have installed on my Mac. I need more than just a good terminal and web browser.</p>

<sup>1</sup> I've been using Linux Mint with Cinnamon for over a year at work and I recommend that too. Cinnamon feels more like Windows and it looks like Elementary feels more like a Mac.</div>
