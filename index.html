			<p>In keeping with the History theme, I want to share a few excerpts from Tim Urban's fantastic article, <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html">Horizontal History</a>, from the other day.</p>
<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/01/horizontal-history.html">Tim Urban</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of us have a pretty terrible understanding of history. Our knowledge is spotty, with large gaps all over the place, and the parts of history we do end up knowing a lot about usually depend on the particular teachers, parents, books, articles, and movies we happen to come across in our lives.</p>
<p>I might know that Copernicus began writing his seminal work On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres in Poland in the early 1510s, but by learning that right around that same time in Italy, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, I get a better picture of the times. By learning that it was right while both of these things were happening that Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in England, the 1510s suddenly begins to take on a distinct personality. These three facts, when put together, allow me to see a more three-dimensional picture of the 1510s—it allows me to see the 1510s horizontally, like cutting out a complete segment of the vine tangle and examining it all together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tim put together an amazing (and huge) image of various historical figures and their relationship to each other. He makes a point in highlighting the fact that people we think of as living in isolated worlds, often worked, and lived around the same time (i.e. Charles Darwin, Mark Twain, Ghandi, Karl Marx, and Nietzsche).</p>
<p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg"><img alt="Horizontal History" src="/images/blog/horiz-history-1.png" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Darwin would have seen Twain as some young kid and he would have shaken his old man fist at Gandhi from the rocking chair on his porch. Meanwhile, Nietzsche would have seen Marx as a guy his dad’s age and Freud as a contemporary, though a bit younger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One section of the picture that I found super interesting, highlights the relationships between a few famous Romans. In this picture you can see the newly minted Roman Empire, with Augustus as it's first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeps#Roman_Emperor">Princeps</a>, grow to it's greatest extend and power, through Trajan and Hadrian, and begin to fall apart, during the time of Marcus Aurelius. It's almost 200 years of history, but only 7 generations.</p>

			<p>I love things like this. </p>
<p><a href="http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/files/2015/12/NationalGeographic_1408861.jpg"><img alt="Nat Geo" src="/images/blog/where-farming-began.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Kottke found this map from <a href="http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/files/2015/12/NationalGeographic_1408861.jpg">National Geographic</a> about the fertile crescent, the origin of farming, and where the domestication of wheat began. </p>
<p>There's so much in this map, and the rest of <a href="http://kottke.org/16/01/the-invention-of-farming">kottke's post</a> but here's a few of my favorite snippets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>13,000 BC:</strong> In Natufian settlements hunter-gatherers built stacked stone houses... with animal hide roofs. Estimated average community size: 18.</p>
<p><strong>8,000 BC:</strong> Thousands lived in farming villages of linked, multiroom homes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's fascinating to me that, in 8,000 BC, large villages existed in some form we'd recognize today, and that farming had basically taken over. According to that picture, the complete transformation of hunter-gatherers to farmers completed around 6,000 BC. That lines up pretty well with the formation of early civilizations in Egypt, and Mesopotamia. </p>
<p>I've always been fascinated by this period in history (well, pre-history) and I'd love to write or read a novel that takes place in the early villages, and towns of civilization. It's a time when so many things changed: nomadic life gave way to sedentary life, and brought with it new ideas, new challenges, organized religion, the invention of organized government, and certainly basic lawmaking.</p>

<p>Of course, while writing this, I ended up diving into the Wikipedia wormhole and ended up on pages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urukagina">this</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_Egypt">this</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_legal_codes">this</a></p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if you have “nothing to hide”. Privacy is a right granted to individuals that underpins the freedoms of expression, association and assembly; all of which are essential for a free, democratic society...</p>
<p>Similarly, when the things you write online, or communicate privately to others, are surveilled, and you self-censor as a result, the rest of us lose your perspective, and the development of further ideas is stifled...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are already <strong>self-censoring</strong>. A 2013 survey of US writers found that after the revelations of the NSA’s mass surveillance regime, 1 in 6 had avoided writing on a topic they thought would subject them to surveillance, and a further 1 in 6 had seriously considered doing so.</p>

			<p>Twitter, we need to talk. I've been thinking, and I don't think our relationship is working out. You're not the social network I fell in love with anymore, you've changed.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, our relationship was so simple: I would follow people, and you would show me their posts in a simple, reverse-chronological timeline. You would recommend new people to follow, based on my habits, and people would follow me, starting the process all over again. The summer of 2012, for us, was the best summer of my life.</p>
<p>Recently though, you've changed. When you came home talking about your new makeover, something you called <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-character-limit-idUSKBN0UJ1S220160105">10k tweets</a>, it was a wakeup call for me. It was a small thing, but it was the last straw. We've been through some tough times together: I was there through the broken search era, the moments fiasco, and the great timeline reorganization. Those were dark times, but I stayed with you. You were different, you didn't try to manipulate me like my <a href="https://www.facebook.com">ex-who-shall-not-be-named</a>. You let me be me, and I loved you for it.</p>
<p>I loved you, even with all your faults, maybe even in spite of them. I loved that DMs have pretty much always been broken, and that your blocking system has always been half-assed. Your faults are what make you unique. Others laughed at us, but I ignored them because they didn't have what we had.</p>
<p>We saw the world together. We watched the world cheer when <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/22/lady-gaga-sound-of-music-oscars_n_6712612.html">Lady Gaga sang The Sound of Music</a>, we cried together when <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/14/michael-brown-ferguson-missouri-timeline/14051827/">the news of events in Ferguson broke</a>, we laid in bed together laughing at <a href="https://twitter.com/justicar/status/661759505978429440">comics of Admiral Akbar</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wilshipley/status/424279529218007040">stupid pictures of salads</a>. You were there for me, during my <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicrocketman/status/338809057345433600">stupid pictures</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicrocketman/status/339928142695251970">of a fedora</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicrocketman/status/338529457373593601">in random places</a> phase; those were dark times. Our love was tested, but we came out of it stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>We've had so many great times together, but I can't keep pretending that everything's ok. I depend on you, like so many others do, for realtime communication, and when you came back from that weekend Social Network's Spirit Quest in that WigWam in Arizona, <a href="/archive/chris-radcliff-on-twitters-timeline-changes/">you almost lost me</a>. You said that you'd <a href="http://globalspin.com/2014/09/communication-news-entertainment/">"rediscovered yourself" and that you were making changes for the better</a>. I tried to talk to you, <em>we all</em> tried to talk to you. We wanted you to go back to your roots, but you were converted by the teachings of Guru Facebook. </p>
<p>I can't keep pretending that we're still happy together. I loved what we were, but not what we are. And so, I'm leaving. Sure, I'll still visit every once and a while, but I think we should start seeing other people. I have to do a little "rediscovering" of my own. I need a social network that respects me, that doesn't reorder my messages because it knows better, or renames "Favorites" to "Likes" in order to desperately cling to the idea of being hip. I want a network that respects developers, and doesn't drive them away. I'm at a point in my life where I want a service that knows what it is, and what it wants. </p>
<p>I guess I'm saying that you've changed. You're driving your friends away, and now you've driven me away too. Sorry to say it out loud, but it's true, and so I'm leaving.</p>
<p>It's not me; it's you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of concrete naming makes this class's responsiblities grow endlessly. What functions should go in a view model? Nobody knows! Just do whatever.</p>
<p>The most charitable thing that I can say about this pattern is that <strong>it changes your kitchen sink from a view controller</strong>, which is not an object that you own (because it's a subclass of an Apple class), to a view model, an object that you do own. The view controller is now free to focus on view-lifecycle events, and is simpler for it. <strong>Still, though, we have a kitchen sink. It's just been moved</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my current projects is a Knockout MVVM project and I agree with everything Soroush is saying. We've pretty much decided that we are just going to use good-old MVC for our project instead of MVVM because of it's needless complexity. I'm reminded of a Gary Berndhart talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkzNHF6rMs"><em>Boundaries</em></a> in which he talks about the Ruby community's struggle with where to put their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">big balls of mud</a>.</p>
