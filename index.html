			<p>Earlier this week I wrote up a simple script to strip out links in log files 
and add them to an RSS feed. Up till now I've been having it monitor a few 
IRC channels and pull out the links in real-time, but I have an idea to use 
this script as a sort of "instant link blogging" tool which I'll hopefully 
get going really soon. </p>
<p>The script can parse most generic log formats, but by default it only parses
<a href="https://textualapp.com">Textual's</a> logs. Currently the script has to be rerun to check for
changes, but that's going to be fixed (hopefully right after this post goes
up). </p>
<p>Check it out. It's <a href="https://github.com/Sonictherocketman/link-feed-generator">hosted, as usual, on GitHub &#8594;</a> </p>

			<p>Editing is difficult; especially difficult when it's your own work.
Professional writers will often advise reading your writing aloud. This helps
you find errors with narrative flow, voice, and sentence structure, but I'm
usually writing in public (i.e. at a coffee shop), so that's not normally an
option. </p>
<p>Siri is a great editing tool, and now I can't imagine writing a
post with out it. When a blog post is in the editing
phase, I'll plug in some headphones and listen to Siri read the post to me. The
first time I'll listen intently, and fix glaring flaws. Each time afterward, I
listen less and less attentively, only fixing what pops out at me. Sometimes I'll even go for a walk while I listen. Being outside and moving around seems to help me untangle particularly pesky prose.</p>
<p>Hearing your wording aloud and with someone else's voice, inflection, and tone can really help you fine tune things like punctuation, voice, and structure. Generally, with Siri, my writing is better, clearer, cleaner, and more concise.</p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup> A great side-effect of using Siri to edit your writing is
that you'll actually know what it sounds like to people who use Siri for
Accessibility reasons. This can help you find and eliminate HTML artifacts or
missing alt-text.

			<p>There's been a lot of talk lately about Swift's relationship with dynamic runtime features. Since I've been developing in Swift for almost two months, I'm perfectly qualified to comment on it in depth, and that's what I'm now going to do (sorry).</p>
<p>First off, I like Swift's syntax a lot. Trailing closures are a thing
I didn't know I needed, and while I have a few nitpicks about the language,
overall I'm really enjoying using it.<sup>1</sup> That said, I've found myself
adopting a few strange habits when writing Swift that I'm not sure are good best
practices, but they do seem to be the way that Apple wants Swift to be written. The biggest offender, and my least favorite feature: <code>switch-case</code> statements.</p>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/05/25/oldie_complains_about_the_old_old_ways">Brent Simmons:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In the old days] There were lots of switch statements. To add, for instance, a copy (or
whatever) implementation to a particular view, you’d have to edit your event
dispatcher to know about that particular view and its copy function. Making
changes required making changes in various places. </p>
<p>- Oldie Complains About the Old Old Ways</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swift's <code>enums</code> are very powerful, but Apple's sample code uses them for so many things.<sup>2</sup> I've found myself <code>switch-case</code>-ing through <code>enums</code> in most of my ViewControllers. It not only looks ugly, but just feels wrong. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript">Gary Bernhardt:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some apologists... [would say] that
it's the programmer's fault for using it in this way... My own view is that 
the behavior that you see a tool being used for is the behavior that that 
tool encourages.</p>
<p>- The Birth and Death of Javascript (~3:30) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brent, and many others, seem concerned about Swift's current relationship with
dynamic features. While I don't dismiss the "old guy complaining about the
new ways" effect, I never like to discount the opinions of long-time, seasoned platform developers. They've seen these kinds of things play out before. I haven't run into most of the other issues and concerns that Brent has brought up, but I have had to write more than a few <code>switch-case</code> statements, which is more than a few too many. </p>
<hr />
<div class="footnote">
<sup>1</sup> When Swift came out, it was a hardcore <a href="http://www.oranlooney.com/lbyl-vs-eafp/">LBYL</a> language. Now that it has <code>try</code> statements, the language feels confused. I don't know which is more "Swifty".
<br />
<sup>2</sup> In Python, the community has strong opinions about what's "Pythonic". The way Apple recommends developers write Swift will have a huge influence on what becomes the "Swifty" style.

					Python-like Context Managers in Swift
				</a>

			<small style="font-style:italic;">Posted on Wed, 25 May 2016 at 03:25 PM </small>

		<div class="article-content">
			<p>One of the most expressive concepts in Python is the context manager, and their
simplest use case is reading and writing files.</p>
<p><code class="python"><pre>
with open('path/to/my/file') as f:
    f.write(some_data)
</pre></code></p>
<p>All of the logic that handles opening the file, checking for errors, and
closing the file is handled automatically by the <code>with</code> statement. This allows
developers to write cleaner, more expressive code without worrying about the
nitty gritty details of opening/closing files, and Python allows you to write
your own context managers. This makes it easy to clean up any code that needs
to execute in a given, safe context.</p>
<h2>Enter Swift</h2>
<p>Swift doesn't have the concept of a context manager, but they can still be easily implemented using Swift's clean and clear closure syntax.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful use-cases for a context manager in Cocoa is in a custom view's <code>drawRect</code> function. CGContexts can get confusing
if you're having to deal with them yourself. If only we had some sort of
manager for these contexts. </p>
<pre><code class="swift">
// First let's define our context manager function.
func drawBlockInSafeContext(block: (context: CGContext?) -> ()) {
    let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext()
    CGContextSaveGState(context)
    block(context: context)
    CGContextRestoreGState(context)
}
class MyView: UIView {
    //...
    func drawRect(rect: CGRect) {
        drawBlockInSafeContext { context in
            // Now we can draw our view 
            // without polluting the root context 
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Context Managers are one of my favorite features of Python and I'd love to see
the concept carried over to Swift. For the record: Omar Abdelhafith has a great tutorial on making more advanced, and more <a href="https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/swift-context-manager-implementing-python-context-manager-in-swift-f327b2b4a7d7#.oys53xm0u">Pythonic Swift Context
