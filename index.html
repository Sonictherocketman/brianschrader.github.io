					Better Image Sharing with Dropbox

			<p>I share a lot of pictures and even more screenshots. Until now, I've been using Dropbox's built-in "Share Screen Shots" feature. It's super convenient because it captures the screenshots automatically and puts a Dropbox link in your clipboard. It might sound silly, but once you've gotten used to it, there's no going back.</p>
<p><img alt="Dropbox screen share" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ju23ajggmn0xuqt/Screenshot%202016-02-05%2014.05.54.png?dl=0" /></p>
<h2>What's Wrong?</h2>
<p>There are a number of problems with sharing these links over social media. If you aren't logged into Dropbox, it put's up a lovely sign-up form instead of the picture, many apps can't show the image inline because they don't know how to scrape the Dropbox page, and the page can sometimes be extremely slow to load. It's super convenient for the poster, but not for the reader.</p>
<p><img alt="Before and after" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/44hqsz8hhyvqx3d/Screenshot%202016-02-05%2014.34.20.png?dl=0" /></p>
<h2>Enter Alfred</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred is an awesome Mac utility</a> that, among other things, replaces the default Spotlight search. It's other main function is managing custom keyboard macros. After <a href="/archive/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/">my switch</a> to <a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a> for microblogging, I needed a new way to share images. Snippets doesn't host images for you like Twitter does, and I didn't want to put the images on imgur or some other service, so I fired up Alfred, and got to work.</p>
<p><img alt="My Macro" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/7zxng5618y88q4r/Screenshot%202016-02-05%2013.10.03.png?dl=0" /></p>
<p>I now have a simple 2 step macro that takes any Dropbox link and converts it to the raw file URL, and puts it in the clipboard. The only downside is that my screenshot-sharing-workflow is now 2 keystrokes instead of 1, but that's something I think I can live with.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cphwp7brw14r0lo/Convert%20Dropbox%20Share%20Link%20to%20Raw%20Image%20URL.alfredworkflow?dl=0">Here's the Alfred Workflow if you want to try it &#8594;</a></p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1</sup> <small>But now I can convert <em>any</em> Dropbox share link to it's raw form, not just images. So I guess it's a net positive.</small></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 750 BC and 400 BC, the Ancient Greeks composed songs meant to be accompanied by the lyre, reed-pipes, and various percussion instruments. More than 2,000 years later, modern scholars have finally figured out how to reconstruct and perform these songs with (it’s claimed) 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>Really cool.</p>

			<p>Text files are really small, and blog posts are just text files. Web pages are getting bigger and bigger over time. <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">Maciej Cegłowski</a> calls it the "The Website Obesity Crisis" (and you should watch his talk). In response to this, I've removed some assets from this site that I wasn't using. Individual articles are now ~12KB plus images, as they should be. </p>

<p><small>I guess I never realized that jQuery was ~90KB.</small></p>

			<p>Well, I finally did it; I finally upgraded this site to use https. I've wanted to do this for a while, and I know that I should have done it years ago, but the thought of having to upgrade Apache, even after all these years, still puts a chill down my spine. Regardless, this site is now certified by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, and my thanks to them for making free SSL certificates a possibility. </p>
<p>I encountered a few troubles while upgrading, and I hope no one noticed, but for anyone looking to do the same thing, here's a few links that helped me through the process:</p>

			<p>It's been <a href="/archive/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/">15 days now</a> since I unofficial-officially left Twitter, and I have a few thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>I'll admit, the first 3 days without Twitter <em>sucked</em>. I was constantly texting everyone I knew, trying to get them to convince me to go back, but to no avail. I wanted to constantly check up and read what people were posting, I wanted, and still want to take part in the bigger conversations that happen on Twitter. To be clear, I said that I would be leaving Twitter as my main platform, and I have, but I do still like to read Twitter, to check up on my friends, and I'm still replying to mentions and the like.</p>
<p>After the first week, I found myself wanting to check Twitter less, but I still wanted an outlet for my sparratic thoughts; enter <a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a>. I have a full <a href="http://sonicrocketman.snippets.xyz">microblog</a> there, and I it set up to cross-post to Twitter. Overall this system has been working great for me. I get the conversations from Twitter, and I'm in control of the content. </p>
<p><a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a> is still in beta, and I'm lucky to be a tester for it, but when it comes out, I'll be sure to let you all know. Since it's just a Jekyll blog though, you can follow it with any plain-old RSS reader (yay Open Web!).</p>
<p>I'm now treating Twitter like I have always treated Facebook: as a place to cross-post things, and respond to comments with the real content residing on my blog, as it should. </p>
<hr />
<p><small>P.S. Another thing I've noticed is that I have a lot more down time now that I'm not checking Twitter every 5 minutes.</small></p>
