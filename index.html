			<p>First off, I'd like to take a second to recommend a fantastic podcast by <a href="https://twitter.com/byzantiumcast">Robin Pierson</a>, <a href="http://thehistoryofbyzantium.com"><em>The History of Byzantium</em></a>. If you've ever heard of it, <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeduncan">Mike Duncan's</a> famous podcast, <a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com"><em>The History of Rome</em></a>, then think of Robin's as the continuation of Mike's work. THoR ended with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and THoB picks up right where Mike left off. It's an excellent podcast, and both are top contenders for my favorite podcasts ever. You should check them out.</p>
<p><img class="image-right" style="padding:10px;"
    src="/images/blog/thob.jpeg" /></p>
<p>I'm by no means caught up with the series. I'm on episode 43 and the series is, at time of writing, on episode 90. Regardless, I'd like to share a story that Robin told in episode 41 <a href="http://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/2013/12/21/episode-41-who-is-a-byzantine/"><em>Who is a Byzantine</em></a> that blew me away.</p>
<p>We often think of the Romans and the Byzantines as two distinct empires, when in fact they were the same thing. The people of the Byzantine Empire called themselves Romans, and they called their empire Rome. Today, we think of the  Roman Empire as a thing long gone, but what's truly amazing is that it has only been 563 years since the fall of the empire. That may seem like a long time, but considering that the empire was around, in some form or another for 2,209 years(!), 500 isn't that long at all. Something that has been around for 2,000 years doesn't just vanish into the night, it leaves remnants that we can see even today, and I'm not talking about the stone monuments. The people who lived as Romans have not disappeared. This clip from episode 41 really hammers that home.</p>
<p><a href="../../audio/no_we_are_romans.mp3">Here's the audio clip &#8594;</a></p>
<p>An excerpt from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hellenism-Byzantium-Transformations-Reception-Classical/dp/0521876885">Anythony Kaldellis' book</a> summarized in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/tasios-kotakis/hellenism-in-byzantium-the-transformations-of-greek-identity-and-the-reception-o/232480986962419/">Facebook
post</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the island was occupied by the Greek navy, Greek soldiers were sent to the villages and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the children ran to see what these Greek soldiers, these Hellenes, looked like. "What are you looking at?" one of them asked. "At Hellenes," we replied. "Are you not Hellenes yourselves," he retorted. "No, we are Romans." [p.42]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What that means is that there are probably still people today who were born calling themselves Romans, 500 years after the empire collapsed, and that is  truly an amazing thought.</p>

		<div class="article-content">
			<p>Today, I removed Google Analytics from this site. I've been
debating this for a while now, ever since the <a href="/archive/re-the-ethics-of-modern-web-ad-blocking/">discussion of ad tracking that
came with the release of iOS 9</a>. I think it's unfair that I use Google 
Analytics to track visitors to this site but that I also block GA on my
machine.</p>
<p>During that whole discussion, I went looking for alternatives, and I've been
using <a href="http://goaccess.io">GoAccess</a> for a few months now in parallel with Google Analytics. 
Overall I'd say the results are vaguely comparable. GoAccess gives me higher 
overall numbers for pageviews and visitor counts, but that's a consequence of it
running on the server and seeing the effects of browser pre-fetching. </p>
<p><img alt="My reports" src="../../images/blog/_reports.png" /></p>
<p>Every night a custom script runs the numbers and spits out a directory with a 
few different reports for that day, and that week so far. It's a good system, 
and although it doesn't have the cool real-time features of Google Analytics, 
I found that that actually keeps me from constantly checking the traffic when 
I'm supposed to be doing something else. Although, GoAccess does have a live 
traffic CLI interface if I really need it.</p>

			<p>There's been <a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/32/pypy.js-pypy-python-in-your-browser">a lot</a> of talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiBfOFqDIAI">recently</a> about using <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebSematicMarkupIsDeadCleanVsMachinecodedHTML.aspx">Javascript as the
assembly language of the web</a>, and tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">ASM.js</a> 
allow developers to write code in any language they want and compile it,
instead of to a native binary, into a subset of Javascript that can be run very
efficiently in the browser. In fact, in testing Mozilla and Unreal were able to
cross compile a few modern video games in to Javascript from C and the games 
played at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWIRUaR9G4w">half native speed!</a> Frankly, that's amazing. </p>
<h2>The Benefits of PyPy.js and ASM.js</h2>
<p>If you've ever seen Gary Bernhart's talk, <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript"><em>The Birth and Death of
Javascript</em></a>
then you've seen this kind of thing before. One really cool project involving 
ASM.js is <a href="http://pypyjs.org">PyPy.js by Ryan Kelly</a> which aims to be a fully compliant PyPy 
implementation running in the browser. One of the big issues with compiling a
language to Javascript has always been how to make it fast, but during 
his PyCon 2015 talk Ryan demonstrated that although the PyPy.js version was 
indeed <a href="https://youtu.be/PiBfOFqDIAI?t=16m19s">10x slower than the native PyPy interpreter, it was over 1.2x <em>faster</em> 
than the native CPython interpreter</a> which is the version of Python that
most of us are actually using. While that may be a testament to just how good 
the PyPy interpreter and JIT compiler are, it does have some interesting 
implications for Python on the web.</p>
<p><center><pre><code class="html">&lt;script type="text/python" src="main.py"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></center></p>
<p>Ryan has <a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/32/pypy.js-pypy-python-in-your-browser">gone on to say</a> that, in his opinion, one of the major issues with
using his PyPy.js in real world cases is that in order to begin running your
code in Python on the web, each page has to download the PyPy.js
interpreter, and it's not a small download. Currently, he says that the
interpreter weighs in around 5MB when compressed. Once it's loaded however,
the browser can cache the interpreter locally and avoid that cost in the
future. To me, initial startup time is not really the big issue though, and
while it's true that 5MB is a crazy big file to be transmitting over the web,
most sites already force users to download that <a href="/archive/re-the-ethics-of-modern-web-ad-blocking/">much data in ad tracking code 
alone</a>. </p>
<h2>What's the problem then?</h2>
<p><img alt="An example of web site memory usage" class="body-image-right" src="/images/blog/act-mon-safari-3.png" /></p>
<p>In my mind, the issues facing developers using this new toolchain are not
initial file downloads or startup time costs. These are one-time costs if
developers leverage the new HTML 5 caching APIs like AppCaching and
LocalStorage. Users are already accustomed to "Installing" software and moving
that process to the web is something I'm confident designers and developers can
do well. My concern has far more to do with runtime performance, specifically
memory usage. In a world where most sites running lots of Javascript already
use <strong>hundreds of megabytes</strong>, full ports of the PyPy interpreter on top of
fully fledged applications are just going to make performance worse.</p>
<p>Web applications are immense resource hogs. What typically takes kilobytes of
memory in a native application takes megabytes on the web. Frankly, that kind
of usage is pretty unacceptable as is, and bolting an interpreter on top of
that will only make the problem worse. </p>

<h2>What's the solution?</h2>
<p>Looking at the history of programming languages and performance, you could make
the argument that this is just the next step. You could, for example, argue
that the jump from native code to interpreted languages like Python had a
similar cost in speed and performance, and I'd grant you that point. It
certainly could be that the web is the single most important and viable
development platform and that the performance costs will be worth it. </p>
<p>The jump to using the web as the virtual machine in which we run the software of 
tomorrow should be one we take with caution. The speed penalties aren't large, 
and I'm happy that that's true, but with most desktop  users still having less 
than 6GB of memory and mobile users teetering around a third of that, developers 
will have to be careful not to try too much at once. Games can allocate gigabytes 
of memory and get away with it, but when a user's entire application suite is in 
the cloud, memory will be, as it almost always has been, a precious resource.</p>
