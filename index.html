			<p>There's been <a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/32/pypy.js-pypy-python-in-your-browser">a lot</a> of talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiBfOFqDIAI">recently</a> about using <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebSematicMarkupIsDeadCleanVsMachinecodedHTML.aspx">Javascript as the
assembly language of the web</a>, and tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">ASM.js</a> 
allow developers to write code in any language they want and compile it,
instead of to a native binary, into a subset of Javascript that can be run very
efficiently in the browser. In fact, in testing Mozilla and Unreal were able to
cross compile a few modern video games in to Javascript from C and the games 
played at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWIRUaR9G4w">half native speed!</a> Frankly, that's amazing. </p>
<h2>The Benefits of PyPy.js and ASM.js</h2>
<p>If you've ever seen Gary Bernhart's talk, <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript"><em>The Birth and Death of
Javascript</em></a>
then you've seen this kind of thing before. One really cool project involving 
ASM.js is <a href="http://pypyjs.org">PyPy.js by Ryan Kelly</a> which aims to be a fully compliant PyPy 
implementation running in the browser. One of the big issues with compiling a
language to Javascript has always been how to make it fast, but during 
his PyCon 2015 talk Ryan demonstrated that although the PyPy.js version was 
indeed <a href="https://youtu.be/PiBfOFqDIAI?t=16m19s">10x slower than the native PyPy interpreter, it was over 1.2x <em>faster</em> 
than the native CPython interpreter</a> which is the version of Python that
most of us are actually using. While that may be a testament to just how good 
the PyPy interpreter and JIT compiler are, it does have some interesting 
implications for Python on the web.</p>
<p><center><pre><code class="html">&lt;script type="text/python" src="main.py"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></center></p>
<p>Ryan has <a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/32/pypy.js-pypy-python-in-your-browser">gone on to say</a> that, in his opinion, one of the major issues with
using his PyPy.js in real world cases is that in order to begin running your
code in Python on the web, each page has to download the PyPy.js
interpreter, and it's not a small download. Currently, he says that the
interpreter weighs in around 5MB when compressed. Once it's loaded however,
the browser can cache the interpreter locally and avoid that cost in the
future. To me, initial startup time is not really the big issue though, and
while it's true that 5MB is a crazy big file to be transmitting over the web,
most sites already force users to download that <a href="/archive/re-the-ethics-of-modern-web-ad-blocking/">much data in ad tracking code 
alone</a>. </p>
<h2>What's the problem then?</h2>
<p><img alt="An example of web site memory usage" class="body-image-right" src="/images/blog/act-mon-safari-3.png" /></p>
<p>In my mind, the issues facing developers using this new toolchain are not
initial file downloads or startup time costs. These are one-time costs if
developers leverage the new HTML 5 caching APIs like AppCaching and
LocalStorage. Users are already accustomed to "Installing" software and moving
that process to the web is something I'm confident designers and developers can
do well. My concern has far more to do with runtime performance, specifically
memory usage. In a world where most sites running lots of Javascript already
use <strong>hundreds of megabytes</strong>, full ports of the PyPy interpreter on top of
fully fledged applications are just going to make performance worse.</p>
<p>Web applications are immense resource hogs. What typically takes kilobytes of
memory in a native application takes megabytes on the web. Frankly, that kind
of usage is pretty unacceptable as is, and bolting an interpreter on top of
that will only make the problem worse. </p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>What's the solution?</h2>
<p>Looking at the history of programming languages and performance, you could make
the argument that this is just the next step. You could, for example, argue
that the jump from native code to interpreted languages like Python had a
similar cost in speed and performance, and I'd grant you that point. It
certainly could be that the web is the single most important and viable
development platform and that the performance costs will be worth it. </p>
<p>The jump to using the web as the virtual machine in which we run the software of 
tomorrow should be one we take with caution. The speed penalties aren't large, 
and I'm happy that that's true, but with most desktop  users still having less 
than 6GB of memory and mobile users teetering around a third of that, developers 
will have to be careful not to try too much at once. Games can allocate gigabytes 
of memory and get away with it, but when a user's entire application suite is in 
the cloud, memory will be, as it almost always has been, a precious resource.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term is probably a shortening of “software engineer,” but its use betrays
a secret: “Engineer” is an aspirational title in software development.
Traditional engineers are regulated, certified, and subject to apprenticeship
and continuing education. Engineering claims an explicit responsibility to
public safety and reliability, even if it doesn’t always deliver.</p>
<p>The title “engineer” is cheapened by the tech industry...</p>
<p>The traditional disciplines of engineering—civil, mechanical, aerospace,
chemical, electrical, environmental—are civic professions as much as
technical ones. Engineers orchestrate the erection of bridges and buildings;
they design vehicles and heavy machinery; they invent and realize the energy
systems that drive this equipment; and they contrive methods for connecting
all of these systems together...</p>
<p>It’s no accident that the most truly engineered of software-engineering
projects extend well beyond the computer. Autonomous-vehicle design offers
the most obvious contemporary example. Autonomous vehicles share the roads 
with human-driven cars, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Those roads are managed, 
maintained, and regulated. 
Engineering addresses complex, large-scale systems...</p>
<p>Other engineering disciplines are subject to certification and licensure... </p>
<p>Licensing processes vary by state, but
Professional Engineers generally need to hold a 4-year degree from an
accredited program in their discipline, pass one or more exams, and possess 4
or more years of professional experience under the supervision of a licensed
engineer. Not all working engineers are or need to be Professional Engineers,
but... to claim that one is an “engineer” in a formal context, licensure is 
usually required...</p>
<p>Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise as
designers and builders of bridges or buildings—or software—emanates from that
responsibility.</p>

					Why I'm switching back to iTunes

			<p>Last week I decided to leave Spotify. I've been using the
service for almost 2 years now, and overall I've really liked it. Their
selection is great, their ability to stream audio over even the slowest
connection is constantly impressive, and while the app's UI isn't perfect, it
has gotten much better. As I said, I've really liked having Spotify, so why 
am I leaving?</p>
<p><img alt="Cancelling spotify" src="/images/blog/cancel-spotify.png" /></p>
<p>Like <a href="http://www.audible.com">another service that I used to pay for but just cancelled</a>, Spotify
hasn't sat well with me over the last few months. It's hard to explain why, but
I guess I feel apprehensive about Spotify being in control of how and where I
listen to music in ways I haven't been before. An example of my frustration 
happened last week when I was trying to AirPlay some music from the Spotify app 
on my iPhone to my media center running <a href="https://osmc.tv">OSMC</a>. When I went looking in the 
AirPlay settings for a destination, my media center showed up, but it wasn't playing.
Originally I thought it might be a bug between OSMC's AirPlay implementation and 
iOS 9, but when I tried streaming from the music app it worked fine. It also
worked fine from iTunes on my Mac, but not from Spotify.
This was extremely frustrating at the time, and it helped me reconcile the
feelings that I'd been having toward Spotify in the recent months. Spotify is a
great service, but like all proprietary services, it gets to decide
how/why/where you can use it's material. This wasn't the first time I'd felt
stuck because of Spotify's imposed limitations, it was just the last straw. I 
decided to resurrect my old music library, <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicrocketman/status/651874066702319616">give iTunes a new icon</a>, purchase 
the music I wanted outright, and cancel Spotify.
<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><img alt="Getting a new icon" src="/images/blog/new-itunes-icon.png" /></p>
<p>Now I know that iTunes is proprietary software with it's own set of limitations
and hurdles, but the music I've purchased from it is mine. I have access to the
raw audio files, and I can convert, burn, and AirPlay them anywhere I want. As
long as it is technically possible to AirPlay to a device it should work, and 
that's becoming more and more important to me. </p>
<p>iTunes is not a great piece of software; it's overcrowded with features, and
begging for a redesign and simplification, but with it's latest release it has
gotten better. Once I cleaned out my old music library and basically started
from scratch, I've really enjoyed using it, and with iCloud music library, I 
get the my-music-is-always-on-whatever-device-I'm-using benefit of a streaming 
service. Although I now have to go back and purchase my favorite albums
again, overall I'm happy with my decision. </p>
<div class="footnote">

1. Another reason I've wanted to switch away from Spotify that is less relevant to
this discussion is that since I don't usually listen to a new album every
month, the cost of paying for a streaming service monthly is a little hard to
justify.

			<p>I've been using Mac OX 10.10 El Capitan for a few days now, and it's been
fairly solid for me. I've encountered some minor bugs, but overall it's a solid
point-oh release.</p>
<p>One new feature that I'm not too fond of, however, is the new "shake to find your
cursor" thing. I really don't know why it bugs me, but it does. So I went
looking for a way to disable it.</p>
<p>The solution is pretty simple. Run the following command in Terminal, and
reboot your machine. </p>
