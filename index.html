					Hosting a Minecraft Server on Linode

			<p>The planets have aligned again, and I've returned to Minecraft. Every once and a while I get the urge to call up some friends, spin up a server, and spend a few hours a week building crazy things and fighting for survival in a blocky world. Usually, I host the server on my laptop, but this time I wanted to try something different (read: more complicated). I'm a developer, and I have the power of the cloud at my fingertips, so why not spin up a Linode instance and host the server there?</p>
<p><img alt="A tower on the hill" class="image-right" style="padding-left:5px;"
    src="/images/blog/mc-tower.jpg"></p>
<p>The first night, I made the terrible mistake of trying to use my existing Linode instance to host the server. A paltry 1 core, 1GB memory machine can run a nice static website, but it's terrible at running a gaming server. If you want the server to constantly crash, and run out of memory, then that's the method you should try</p>
<p>If you actually want to play the game, I recommend using Linode's 4 core, 4GB memory instances. Unless you plan on having tens of people on the server at once, its going to be more that enough. The best part is that those instances are $0.06/hr. Last night I played with a friend for 4 hours, and it cost me a whole 24¢.</p>
<p>I've written a little <a href="https://gist.github.com/Sonictherocketman/221c6fad8ea76657d2b2">shell script</a> to do the installation automatically, and even sign the EULA. So now, whenever I want to play with some friends, I can click a whole three buttons in Linode's admin panel, SSH into the server, run my script and start playing. Then when we're done I can copy the world onto my Mac via FTP, and shut down the instance. Super simple, cheap, and fast.</p>
<p>The cloud is pretty awesome sometimes.</p>

					FBI tells Apple to Create a Master Key to iOS

			<p>This has been an interesting morning. Earlier today, Apple released a statement basically claiming that the FBI asked it to create an insecure version of iOS that would allow them to gain access to the data on a person's iPhone. They claim that they want this power to help their investigation of the San Bernardino case, but as many people have pointed out, this is not just about this one case, and it sets a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">Tim Cook (via mjtsai)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the FBI has requested data that’s in our possession, we have provided it. Apple complies with valid subpoenas and search warrants, as we have in the San Bernardino case. We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI, and we’ve offered our best ideas on a number of investigative options at their disposal.</p>
<p>We have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their intentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within our power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone.</p>
<p>Specifically, the FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to note: Apple hasn't just given the FBI the information they need, but they've also provided them with engineers to advise them. From the post, it seems like Apple has been more than helpful to the FBI during this case, and now the FBI wants even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://marco.org/2016/02/17/not-about-this-5c">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s their excuse to establish precedent and permanent backdoors for themselves so they can illegally spy on anyone’s data whenever they please. They’re shamelessly using a horrible tragedy to get themselves more power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after Apple released this statement, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/eff-support-apple-encryption-battle">EFF said that they will file in support of Apple</a>. I hope that their support will help Apple convince the government that this is a bad idea, but unfortunately I don't think it's going to do any good.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Update (Feb-23):</strong> Apple has <a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/answers/">posted a FAQ</a> to help answer a few common questions and to further the discussion. Here's an excerpt that sums up the point really well:</p>

<p>The only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn’t abused and doesn’t fall into the wrong hands is to never create it.</p>

					Better Image Sharing with Dropbox

			<p>I share a lot of pictures and even more screenshots. Until now, I've been using Dropbox's built-in "Share Screen Shots" feature. It's super convenient because it captures the screenshots automatically and puts a Dropbox link in your clipboard. It might sound silly, but once you've gotten used to it, there's no going back.</p>
<p><img alt="Dropbox screen share" src="../../images/blog/dropbox_ss.png" /></p>
<h2>What's Wrong?</h2>
<p>There are a number of problems with sharing these links over social media. If you aren't logged into Dropbox, it put's up a lovely sign-up form instead of the picture, many apps can't show the image inline because they don't know how to scrape the Dropbox page, and the page can sometimes be extremely slow to load. It's super convenient for the poster, but not for the reader.</p>
<p><img alt="Before and after" src="../../images/blog/tw_ss.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Enter Alfred</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred is an awesome Mac utility</a> that, among other things, replaces the default Spotlight search. It's other main function is managing custom keyboard macros. After <a href="/archive/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/">my switch</a> to <a href="http://snippets.today">Snippets.today</a> for microblogging, I needed a new way to share images. Snippets doesn't host images for you like Twitter does, and I didn't want to put the images on imgur or some other service, so I fired up Alfred, and got to work.</p>
<p><img alt="My Macro" src="../../images/blog/alfred.jp2" /></p>
<p>I now have a simple 2 step macro that takes any Dropbox link and converts it to the raw file URL, and puts it in the clipboard. The only downside is that my screenshot-sharing-workflow is now 2 keystrokes instead of 1, but that's something I think I can live with.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cphwp7brw14r0lo/Convert%20Dropbox%20Share%20Link%20to%20Raw%20Image%20URL.alfredworkflow?dl=0">Here's the Alfred Workflow if you want to try it &#8594;</a></p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1</sup> <small>But now I can convert <em>any</em> Dropbox share link to it's raw form, not just images. So I guess it's a net positive.</small></p>

<p>Between 750 BC and 400 BC, the Ancient Greeks composed songs meant to be accompanied by the lyre, reed-pipes, and various percussion instruments. More than 2,000 years later, modern scholars have finally figured out how to reconstruct and perform these songs with (it’s claimed) 100% accuracy.</p>
