I've added a feed to the homepage, and styled each post as an entry. Hopefully this'll make it possible to follow this site in a MicroSub reader. I've also completely redone the nav and the core styling. The nav bar on this site has bugged me for years, but until tonight it never bothered me enough to actually fix it. That deed is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember the last time I actually dove into the templates and CSS that power this blog. The last significant change would have to be at least three years ago. Hopefully this time I won't have to touch it for even longer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>microformats</category><category> spring cleaning</category><category> blogging</category><category> meta</category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/spring-cleaning-and-microformats</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 07:41:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>An Uplifting Tale in these Dark Times</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/an-uplifting-tale-in-these-dark-times/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people, these last few weeks have been challenging. I've been working from home for years, so California's stay-at-home order hasn't affected my work all that much, but I do find myself battling a constant anxiety. I'm an optimist by nature, but these last few weeks have stretched that belief to its limits and every day I've found myself flailing in a sea of uncertainty while a thick blanket of brain fog smothers out the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that put me in the perfect head-space for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from the Guardian. I needed an optimism booster shot and I found it. A story of six boys who set out on an ill-fated journey in 1965. Sounds super uplifting right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one noticed the small craft leaving the harbour that evening. Skies were fair; only a mild breeze ruffled the calm sea. But that night the boys made a grave error. They fell asleep. A few hours later they awoke to water crashing down over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full article is definitely worth a read. It follows a similar plot to the Lord of the Flies, except with the exact opposite conclusion. In this story, the boys are inherently good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't spoil how, but all six kids are eventually rescued (after &lt;strong&gt;15 months&lt;/strong&gt;) and are reunited with their families. It's a great story, but one passage stood out to me more than any other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolo fashioned a makeshift guitar from a piece of driftwood, half a coconut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat &#8211; an instrument Peter has kept all these years &#8211; and played it to help lift their spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dark times we turn to things that bring us together. For many, that thing is music. I don't, for a second, want to re-live what those boys went through, but it makes me extremely happy to know that even in their darkest times they turned to one of mankind's oldest remedies to lift their spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't gather in crowds right now, but music can still help us get through this crisis together. We just need to be creative with how we play it.&lt;/p&gt;

It has an interesting section about &lt;a href="https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/man/man5/xorg.conf.5.xhtml#heading11"&gt;X Video Adapters&lt;/a&gt; that got me thinking; though it wasn't what was on the page that got me all wound up, &lt;em&gt;it's what wasn't&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VIDEOADAPTOR SECTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to say how this works. Maybe nobody knows ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presume that last bit is a joke, but maybe it's not. The X Windowing system dates back to the early 80's, and it's gone through so many iterations and revisions that it's probably safe to say that there are definitely parts that literally no one understands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As computing and the Internet get older, the nuances and particulars of most software will be lost as it fades from living memory. It's quite possible that, years from now, we'll all be depending on lots of software that no one has seen or touched in decades. Its secrets lost, its workings unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time Immemorial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London"&gt;The City of London&lt;/a&gt;, not to be mistaken for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"&gt;city named London&lt;/a&gt;, is an ancient city alive today in the center of the capital of the U.K.. To this day it has its own customs, rights, and traditions, and in most respects it's more of a country than a city. This small 1-square mile of land is extremely special. Why? Because it always has been. The &lt;a href="https://www.cgpgrey.com/blog/the-secret-city-of-london.html"&gt;founding of The City of London predates the country that surrounds it by several hundred years&lt;/a&gt;. For as far back as anyone can remember the City has been there, lying on the Thames. It gets its special status and powers, not from The People, or from God, but from Time Immemorial. The City just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, and always has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still in the bright, starry-eyed youth of the software world. But our software, should it continue to run that long, may outlive its founders, maintainers, and followers. In the future we may find that lots of software just is, and always has been.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Future help articles may offer little more than this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why does it do X?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just always has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; NASA already has lots of experience with software that has outlived and outlasted its creators, maintainers, and who's documentation has been lost to fire, flood, and the careless efforts of man.

Aside from all of the extremely troubling things in the world right now, today was great. In the morning, &lt;a href="https:////adventurerscodex.com/"&gt;Adventurer's Codex&lt;/a&gt; got one step closer to its next release (which is going to be a big one) and in the evening, a set of features I've been building for a few months, and &lt;a href="/archive/the-web-as-a-social-network/"&gt;wanting for a few years&lt;/a&gt;, got pushed out to &lt;a href="https://pine.blog/"&gt;Pine.blog&lt;/a&gt; along with a refreshed home page that I put together in the last few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full details of the &lt;a href="https://pine.blog/"&gt;Pine.blog&lt;/a&gt; release &lt;a href="https://blog.pine.blog/2020/03/pine-blog-and-the-social-web/"&gt;are posted on the official blog&lt;/a&gt; but the important bit is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the latest version of Pine.blog, one-click replies have arrived on the Open Web. Bloggers on Pine.blog now have the ability to reply to posts in their timelines, anything in the Feed Directory, and even to other replies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've wanted this feature for a long time. Replies, combined with the silent launch of Webmentions earlier this year finally turns Pine.blog from a feed reader and a blogging platform into a full blown social network powered by the Open Web. This was the goal of my &lt;a href="/archive/the-open-microblog-standard/"&gt;Microblogger&lt;/a&gt; project back in the day, it was part of my &lt;a href="/archive/a-vision-of-the-open-web/"&gt;Vision for the Open Web&lt;/a&gt;, and it's been my &lt;a href="/archive/twitter-and-the-open-web/"&gt;dream ever since 2014&lt;/a&gt; when I was still using Twitter and hoping it would evolve into what Pine.blog is now (granted on a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; smaller scale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't let anyone tell you that you can't accomplish your dreams: you can. It might take a lot longer than you thought, but it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more do we have to imagine what the Web as a Social Network could be. We have it, we just need to encourage others to join us. Whether you're using your own IndieWeb site, Pine.blog, or Micro.blog you're helping to make the Web better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time coming, but I can now include Pine.blog in that list without qualification.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>pine.blog</category><category> good</category><category> success</category><category> win</category><category></category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/a-good-day</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 05:34:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>That's When I Knew: I Can't Actually Use macOS</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/thats-when-i-knew-i-cant-actually-use-macos/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I got a new laptop for work: a new 15" MacBook Pro.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It was the first time I'd gotten a new Mac since 2014 when I got the MacBook Pro I'm using to write this post; this Mac has been my primary machine ever since. I use it for everything: I built &lt;a href="https://adventurerscodex.com"&gt;Adventurer's Codex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pine.blog"&gt;Pine.blog&lt;/a&gt; with it, I used it for over 4 years as my work computer, I've taken it all across the country and for most of that time I've carried it with me every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all that time though, I haven't been using macOS as it comes from Apple, I've heavily customized just about everything. I've written tons of little command-line utilities, keyboard macros, Apple Script extensions, and installed bits of extra utilities to make this laptop work &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the way I want. What's more, when I got this machine, I migrated my previous MacBook onto it. In short, there's now a decade of customizations and tweaks baked into macOS, and it's been long enough now that I have no idea which behaviors are mine and which are part of the macOS that Apple ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which presents a problem when setting up a new Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, when I use my Mac, I don't really think about what I'm doing. My hands do things, and the thing I want to happen, does; all in perfect harmony. One thing I knew, coming into this new Mac, was that my hands would likely stumble over this new bigger, chunkier keyboard. I was right, but for this I was prepared. I was less prepared for what came next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;That Demoralizing Beep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There I was, welcoming a new friend into the world, stumbling sure, but maintaining my balance. It was then, for what reason I know not, I heard a sound I'd not heard in a long time, a long time: the error chime. Instantly, I was lost, adrift on unfamiliar shores that at first glance looked just like the islands I'd called home for a decade, but which, on second glance turned out to be nothing more than a mirage that obscured the sharp rocks on which I was now adrift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a flurry, I reached for &lt;a href=""&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;. I whacked Command + Space and found only Spotlight. When I asked Spotlight for &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; and whacked Enter, instead of seeing my familiar System Preferences, I heard only that chime again. I started to panic. It was then I realized that I was truly alone. Pastebot had fallen, Shiori did not heed my call, and Terminal no longer spoke my native tongue. Somehow, I managed to open Safari, but when I searched for &lt;code&gt;alfred&lt;/code&gt; I was thrust to Google.com, a far cry from my &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com"&gt;usual port of call&lt;/a&gt;. I was lost; adrift on the farthest shores. Unmoored, scared, and alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alfred using Settings to Open System Preferences" src="/images/blog/alfred-set.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was this strange world? I knew not. For now I only knew the screams of error demons emanating from the void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Thrilling Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, through the most heroic of efforts, I managed to install a few utilities, apps, and copy over some scripts from my personal Mac onto this new one. It still doesn't feel like home, but it's close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This harrowing, 15-minute adventure has caused me to reflect more on how I use my tools. I'm not sure I like knowing that I'll either need to migrate this Mac forever, or that I'll need to start over and rebuild my foundations sometime in the future. I like my shortcuts, but that's just it: they're mine, not Apple's not yours, not anyone else's; just mine. I'm not sure I want the burden of migrating or re-learning everything. Is the only answer for me to slowly wean myself off of my little tweaks, my time-savers? I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's been interesting to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
    &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This was prior to the 16" coming out.&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Somehow Alfred knows that "set", short for Settings, refers to System Preferences. I have no idea how it learned this or when, but I've never once asked for that app by its real name.

What follows is a bit about why and what I've learned from the experience. In the end, nothing was lost and the site is back up. My apologies to all of my users; thanks for your patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today did not go as planned. As I do, this morning I opened Pine.blog to read the news and instead of seeing a newly updated timeline, the app had logged me out. Worse still, I couldn't log back in, and the website wasn't responding. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick investigation revealed that the disk had filled, which caused the creation of new sessions and access tokens to fail. Admittedly, I don't have any sort of disk usage monitoring on the database server, but because I'd just doubled the amount of storage on that server less than two months ago, I wasn't really thinking it would fill up anytime soon. Regardless, it had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Causes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, a combination of external factors and my own design decisions led to the disk filling up much faster than I was expecting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeds are kinda huge (sometimes).&lt;/strong&gt; A few Pine.blog users have feeds that seem to contain hundreds of new items every hour, which Pine.blog will faithfully parse and store in their timelines. In some cases, this meant that such a feed could contain 200,000+ items in only a few weeks. What's worse is that because of a recent change to how timelines work, a timeline can't hold that many items anymore which means Pine.blog was storing a ton of data it would never actually use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pine.blog stores a lot of data.&lt;/strong&gt; By design, Pine.blog doesn't really delete items that it has previously parsed and it stores multiple copies of certain data to make it easier to serve, but this drastically inflates storage requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I misunderstood my tools.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not a database guy; I'm an app developer. To me Postgres has always been a bit magical, and today that bit me. About a month ago, I thought I'd read somewhere that the newest versions of Postgres didn't need to be routinely vacuumed, and that running a daily vacuum was an old, outdated practice, so I stopped doing it. &lt;em&gt;This was a bad idea&lt;/em&gt;. Without that daily cleaning, the Pine.blog database couldn't reuse space that it no longer needed, and so it kept asking the OS for more disk space, right up until there wasn't any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end it was the mundane, but powerful combination of a few small things that caused the issues today: some overzealous design choices, a few misunderstandings, and a few overactive feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away, I should admit this whole thing could have been solved a lot sooner. I underestimated the issue at first and tried to keep the site up while I fixed the issue. In hindsight it would have been a lot faster and easier to resize the server to something that had more disk space, vacuum the database, resize the filesystem and scale back down. This whole thing could have been solved in 1-2 hours instead of 6-8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, here's the two things that I'll be changing about how Pine.blog works in order to prevent this problem in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nightly vacuum is back. Removing it was a dumb idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pine.blog will no longer store the entire history of external feeds.&lt;/strong&gt; This one isn't fully in effect yet, but expect the change soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of recently, each Pine.blog timeline has a maximum length of 3000 posts. Once a post falls off the end, you won't be able to find it by scrolling backward in your timeline anymore. This is exactly what Twitter does (although their limit is a modest 800 posts). Feeds will soon do something similar. Pine.blog will keep just the most recent posts in a feed (~3-5000 posts in total) and anything beyond that point will be removed from Pine.blog's database.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that no one will actually notice these changes once they're rolled out, but to me they mark the end of the road for a naive dream I had back when I started Pine.blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out parsing and storing entire portions of the web is hard.
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1.&lt;/sup&gt; Hosted blogs are uneffected. Pine.blog will store your entire blog . This change only effects feeds from outside of Pine.blog.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2.11.2020_Data%20Protection%20Act.pdf"&gt;From the bill&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The privacy of an individual is directly affected by the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to protect the privacy of individuals, it is necessary and proper for Congress to regulate the collection, maintenance, use, processing, storage, and dissemination of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I haven't finished reading the actual bill yet, I applaud Senator Gillibrand for proposing the idea. Her bill lays out what the new agency would focus on: regulating how data is collected, used and processed. She also explicitly carving out, what she calls, "High-Risk Data Practices" that would require extra protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some High-Risk Practices (formatting mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term "high-risk data practice" means an action by a covered entity that involves...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;any processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;processing the personal data of an individual that has not been obtained directly from the individual...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;processing which involves tracking an individual&#8217;s geolocation...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Senator's own press release on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. [The Agency would maintain] the most innovative, successful tech sector in the world by ensuring fair competition within the digital marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The agency would promote data protection and privacy innovation across sectors, developing and providing resources such as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that minimize or even eliminate the collection of personal data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The agency would ensure equal access to privacy protection and protect against &#8220;pay-for-privacy&#8221; or &#8220;take-it-or-leave-it&#8221; provisions in service contracts&#8212;because privacy, including online privacy, is a right that should be enforced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. [The Agency would prepare] the American government for the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The agency would advise Congress on emerging privacy and technology issues, like deepfakes and encryption. It would also represent the United States at international forums regarding data privacy and inform future treaty agreements regarding data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my reading, it looks like this agency would also have the teeth to enforce its rules as opposed to the current FTC rules which companies basically ignore. An agency with this new authority would be utterly transformative for the U.S. Tech Sector and for the lives of everyday citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully support this bill.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>law</category><category> data protection</category><category> privacy</category><category> Kirsten Gillibrand</category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/an-agency-that-protects-data</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2020 02:30:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>A Sobering Thought</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/a-sobering-thought/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Rarely do silver bullets actually exist; the truth resists simplicity. &lt;a href="https://teamtrees.org"&gt;Tree planting often&lt;/a&gt; looked at as a cheap, effective, and catch-all solution to combatting carbon emissions, but that just isn't true.

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this morning, I watched a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXkbdELr4EQ&amp;amp;app=desktop"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/films/2019/09/18/climate-change-the-trouble-with-trees?linkId=100000008031533"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; which covered the topic pretty well (there's even more videos and &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/films/2019/09/18/climate-change-the-trouble-with-trees?linkId=100000008031533"&gt;information in the linked article&lt;/a&gt;). While the through-line of the video is that tree planting, when done correctly, can have huge benefits and help combat climate change, Professor Simon Lewis drives home a really sobering point &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/EXkbdELr4EQ?t=515"&gt;right at the end&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, the trouble with trees tackling climate change is space. &lt;strong&gt;There&#8217;s just not enough land in the world&lt;/strong&gt; to plant enough trees to offset all the carbon emissions from fossil fuels. We could say, let&#8217;s restore forest on every single piece of land that used to have forest on from before agriculture. And if we did that it would be about 200bn tonnes of carbon. Now that sounds a lot, but to put it in context, &lt;strong&gt;that&#8217;s about 20 years worth of emissions&lt;/strong&gt; at present rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Professor Simon Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go ahead, plant trees.* Just know: we need a lot more than just trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, though, it is very problematic that such a powerful player in our democracy has no accountability. Liberty is not simply about laws, or culture, it is also about structure, and it is right to be concerned about the centralized nature of companies like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms that have as many problems as Facebook does can always be improved, but by design they can never be good enough because their size alone is one of the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difference in scale can become a difference in kind. Facebook and other large Tech companies have more users than most nations have citizens. We look down on autocratic governments, and will hopefully continue to do so. We can't forget that these large corporations are a new form of the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a words to describe organizations of large enough size that exert control over vastly different groups of people and that aren't answerable to their constituents. We call them autocracies; we call them empires.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>social web</category><category> software</category><category> facebook</category><category> social media</category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/high-tech-empires</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2019 01:20:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Remembering Things is Hard</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/remembering-things-is-hard/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not very good at remembering things, even simple things, and I'm even worse at grinding (doing a simple or repetitive task more than once). That's one reason why I love being a developer: often times, I can script simple, repetitive, and common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to development, although most of my projects leverage some form of automated continuous testing and linting, by the time I've pushed up my code and the tests have run, I've moved on to some other task. This means that when my code has a failing test or a linting error, I have to stop the new thing that I'm doing, stash my changes, and fix the error. I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; remember to run the tests before I push my code, but I never do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in lieu of doing the hard work to remember to run the tests and becoming a better person in the process, I've written a &lt;code&gt;pre-commit&lt;/code&gt; script that runs before I commit my code. That way I can't commit my code without fixing the error, or explicitly ignoring it (with the &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; flag).*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
* This also helps avoid the unprofessional looking "Fixes linting" commits.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my &lt;code&gt;.git/hooks/pre-commit&lt;/code&gt; file for any Django project. Give it a shot yourself and let me know if it helps you write better code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="bash"&gt;#! /bin/bash
set -e;
log() { echo "[$(date)] $1"; }

cat &lt;&lt; EOF
