I don't feel like I'm as disappointed as most in Apple's hardware, but I do think that macOS could use some real attention as some annoying bugs have slipped into the last few updates to my Mac. I'm still using El Capitan and liking it a lot, and my 2014 13" Retina Macbook Pro is still my favorite computer ever. Overall I'm happy with my setup, but Apple's future for the Mac still worries me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-mac-os-x/"&gt;Wesley Moore&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="//mjtsai.com/blog/2017/01/03/finding-an-alternative-to-mac-os-x/"&gt;Michael Tsai&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deeply value the consistency, versatility, reliability and integration of Mac OS X and the excellent quality hardware it runs on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course even if I make the switch there are a number of possible drawbacks, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time required to find replacements for all the software I use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of equally high standard replacements for software...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elementary is stunning and definitely my favourite. It won&#8217;t appeal to everyone but their philosophies and direction really resonate with me. Specifically they have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A primary, native programming language (Vala, no Python and JS \o/).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A model for funding ongoing development (Bug bounties, Patreon, asking for payment when downloading).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designers as well as developers on the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just casually looking at Elementary, I have to say I really like the look of it. If I was going to switch right now, which I'm certainly not, I would use Elementary. Actually if I ever want a nice Linux GUI for anything, I'd probably use Elementary.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest switching cost for me is still the lack of comparable software on any other platform. The Mac's software ecosystem is fantastic (though a lot of people complain about how it could be so much more, it's still the best by a long shot). There just aren't alternatives for most of the fantastic software I have installed on my Mac. I need more than just a good terminal and web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I've been using Linux Mint with Cinnamon for over a year at work and I recommend that too. Cinnamon feels more like Windows and it looks like Elementary feels more like a Mac.&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>macOS</category><category> linux</category><category> alternatives</category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/alternatives-to-macos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 14:15:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Sony MDR Extra-Bass Bluetooth Headphones Review</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/sony-mdr-extra-bass-bluetooth-headphones-review/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="image-center" src="../../images/blog/mdr-bt-headphones.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a long time since I've had a pair of Bluetooth headphones. Years back I had a pair of no-name brand on-the-ear headphones, but they were pretty crappy and would drop out if I moved my head at all to the right. For years I've used Apple's EarPods when I'm out, and a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007E7C8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1"&gt;Audio-Technica Closed-back Headphones&lt;/a&gt; at work. They're not the most comfortable things, (I can't wear either of them for more than about 2 hours continuously), but they sound great for the price. That said, I've needed good headphones at home for a while, and I knew I'd be going on a trip to Japan this fall, so I'd need to eventually get some new headphones for the plane/train anyway. Eventually, I landed on the fantastically named &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MCHE38O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=sonicrocketma-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00MCHE38O&amp;amp;linkId=7fea20adb66b275c9ae47aab73f98901"&gt;Sony MDRXB950BT/B Extra Bass Bluetooth Headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;em&gt;preferred&lt;/em&gt; criteria for my new headphones was (in order of preference):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under $200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-the-Ear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noise-Cancelling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foldable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sony MDR Headphones fit most of those criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under $200 &amp;#10003;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable &amp;#10003;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-the-Ear &amp;#10003;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth &amp;#10003;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noise-Cancelling &amp;#x2717;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at least Noise Dampening &amp;#10003;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foldable &amp;#x2717;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partially Foldable &amp;#10003;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right out of the gate I'll say that these headphones are extremely comfortable to wear, even for long durations, they look great, they pair easily with multiple devices with no random disconnects&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the battery lasts quite a while. The Bluetooth connectivity seems stable enough and strong enough that I can reliably use the headphones with my phone in another room. Thankfully, the onboard controls are pretty simple and usable, and they don't feel cheap. Everything about these headphones from the ear cuffs, and headband, to the rotating hinges feels sturdy and well built to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly there are a few things about the Sonys that don't feel on-par with the stuff I just mentioned. Most importantly, while they do sound decent (more than good enough for my needs) the audio quality isn't as good as I think it should be, and there's an audible hiss from them whenever they're on. It isn't really noticeable if something is playing, (even softly) but it is there, and occasionally I do pick up on it. Just for reference, I've had others listen for the hiss, and most can't hear it (maybe I just have good hearing). On the noise dampening side, the Sonys do block most ambient noise, and were enough for me on the plane, but they don't work any miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having used them for over two weeks now, including 2 10+ hour flights and multiple 3+ hour long train rides, I can say confidently that I really enjoy these headphones. The comfort alone is huge, and since I'm using them in mostly quiet settings or caf√©s the lack of noise cancelling doesn't usually matter. The sub-optimal bluetooth audio quality is a shame, but it's not bad. Notably these headphones have a "Bass-Boost" feature. It's not something I need or really want, especially since turning it on makes podcasts instantly unlistenable, but it does its job well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not an audiophile, but I can say that my Audio Techinicas are better sounding headphones, (and more accurate) but the Sonys are hundreds of times more comfortable, and since they're wireless, I'm fine with that tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Having never used my Mac with Bluetooth headphones, I have no good baseline for comparison, but iTunes seems to be really buggy when playing over Bluetooth. Occasionally it will refuse to play music after the connection is established, and I have to quit and relaunch. It's ok, it's not like it's 2016 or anything.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get RSS updates for a single channel
To get an RSS feed of a single channel&#8217;s uploads, paste the channel URL into your RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get RSS updates for all subscriptions
To import all your YouTube subscriptions to your RSS reader, you can use our OPML file download feature...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea when this feature was added, but it's the first time I've seen it.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Most articles about YouTube's RSS feeds are either hacks or from &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/google-reader-is-shutting-down-here-are-the-best-alter-5990456"&gt;ancient history&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know what mad(wo)man is behind this, but I love them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Hopefully this isn't just some short-lived A/B testing or worse.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explained how MP3s work, and why this is a problem, on Accidental Tech Podcast last week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See for yourself: here&#8217;s that same podcast in VBR. Note that the file is 25% smaller and the theme song (at 1:22:47 in the original file) sounds way nicer in the VBR version. But if you seek to the same timestamp as the above share link &#8212; 1:24:30 &#8212; you&#8217;ll hear the wrong audio. The player will say 1:24:30, but you&#8217;re actually hearing the audio at 1:25:16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is direct follow up to his &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+CdTym-vo/1:23:49"&gt;really awesome discussion on ATP&lt;/a&gt; this week about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_bitrate"&gt;Variable BitRate (VBR)&lt;/a&gt; MP3s and why they're more space-efficient, better sounding, and yet no one uses them. It's a really interesting topic, and as usual, Marco does a great job illustrating the problem and the many possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with so many things in software, the solutions are rarely limited by technology, they're limited by the standards we use (or don't use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://marco.org/2016/08/15/vbr-mp3-plea"&gt;Why don&#8217;t podcasts use VBR MP3s? Because iOS and macOS don&#8217;t accurately seek them &amp;#8594;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mp3</category><category> podcast</category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/more-efficient-vbr-mp3s-and-podcasting</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 12:30:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Tabletop Audio</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/tabletop-audio/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I really like &lt;a href="http://www.tabletopaudio.com"&gt;Tabletop Audio&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great tool for anyone who's running a Tabletop RPG, or for writers who're looking for atmospheric background music. There's lots of different genres represented (much more than typical fantasy stuff). I've been using the site for a while, but I just discovered the new SoundPad feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoundPad was designed for those of you who wanted more control over your sonic environments. Instead of fire-and-forget 10 minute ambiences, each SoundPad is made up of a few dozen sounds, divided into categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent a bit of time today playing with SoundPad, and it's really cool. Instead of hunting for just the right atmospheric music, or just defaulting to the &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-original/id596951310"&gt;Skyrim soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, I can tweak and tune the music, and sound-effects in the game. One of the coolest features of SoundPads, and playlists, is the ability to send live links to the music/sounds you're mixing.&lt;/p&gt;

If you haven't heard of this YouTube
channel, you should check it out (you should read his blog posts too). So far, 
he's mostly built huts (&lt;a href="https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/building-a-hut-with-a-kiln-fired-tiled-roof-underfloor-heating-and-mud-pile-walls/"&gt;one even had a fireplace&lt;/a&gt;) and primitive tools, but with the latest video, he's taken on building a furnace hot enough to smelt metal. It's super simple in concept, and looks pretty effective. &lt;/p&gt;

things (well, that and &lt;a href="https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com"&gt;Primitive Tech&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos have a suspiciously PBS feel, reminicent of shows like &lt;a href="https://blogs.chapman.edu/huell-howser-archives/"&gt;California's Gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/"&gt;Nova&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

They
have a lot of really great and simple tips and tricks to help developers write
good code and refactor bad code, and they have lots of practical examples for
each of their techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's two of my favorite tips: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism"&gt;Replace Conditional with Polymorphism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique adheres to the Tell-Don't-Ask principle: instead of asking an
object about its state and then performing actions based on this, it is much
easier to simply tell the object what it needs to do and let it decide for
itself how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removes duplicate code. You get rid of many almost identical conditionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to add a new execution variant, all you need to do is add a new
subclass without touching the existing code (Open/Closed Principle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses"&gt;Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
You have a group of nested conditionals and it is hard to determine the normal
flow of code execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;
Isolate all special checks and edge cases into separate clauses and place them
before the main checks. Ideally, you should have a "flat" list of conditionals,
one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to the first tip, I find myself falling into the trap of if/elsing
though a list of cases just to determine what to do next, or what state to
alter. Unfortunately, a lot of Python libraries are guilty of this practice. 
Replacing each of the cases with concrete subclasses would definitely help 
developers keep track of the various code paths, all while making the code cleaner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the second tip, one of my favorite features of Swift is its &lt;a href="https://thatthinginswift.com/guard-statement-swift/"&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; statement. It keeps the normal execution logic clean, while still allowing the developer to handle rare, or extraordinary cases easily. &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>refactoring</category><category> programming</category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/easy-refactoring-with-source-making</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2016 11:58:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Latest Project: Log Linker</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/latest-project-log-linker/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I wrote up a simple script to strip out links in log files 
and add them to an RSS feed. Up till now I've been having it monitor a few 
IRC channels and pull out the links in real-time, but I have an idea to use 
this script as a sort of "instant link blogging" tool which I'll hopefully 
get going really soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script can parse most generic log formats, but by default it only parses
&lt;a href="https://textualapp.com"&gt;Textual's&lt;/a&gt; logs. Currently the script has to be rerun to check for
changes, but that's going to be fixed (hopefully right after this post goes
up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out. It's &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sonictherocketman/link-feed-generator"&gt;hosted, as usual, on GitHub &amp;#8594;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><category>python</category><category> irc</category><category> rss</category><guid isPermaLink="true">http://brianschrader.com/archive/latest-project-log-linker</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2016 22:17:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><title>Linode's 13th Birthday</title><link>http://brianschrader.com/archive/linodes-13th-birthday/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.linode.com/2016/06/16/linodes-13th-birthday-gifts-for-all/"&gt;Linode Blog:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13 years later, it&#8217;s amazing how much we&#8217;ve grown. According to a study by
CloudHarmony, Linode is the 4th largest cloud provider to the top 10,000
Alexa websites, following only Amazon, Rackspace, and IBM. Not bad. We have
helped over half a million customers, launched nearly 12 million Linode
servers, and now have more than 100 employees, all while remaining
independent and privately owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Linode as my host of choice for a few years now, and I have
absolutely no complaints. They've been great to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a token of our gratitude, we&#8217;re announcing free RAM upgrades for both new
 and existing customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a non-trivial upgrade; even though I only use the cheapest instances, I'm
still getting 100% more RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
