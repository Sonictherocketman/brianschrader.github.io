My name is Brian Schrader. I'm an independent software developer living in San Diego, CA. This site is my little home on the internet where I go on (and on) about things that are important to me.

I own and run [SkyRocket Software][sky], my indie software company, where I make things some people like. I'm also a co-founder of [Adventurer's Codex][ac], a tool for enhancing and tracking D&D games. And I'm the lead singer, song-writer, and rhythm guitarist in a band called [Academic Prison][ap].
