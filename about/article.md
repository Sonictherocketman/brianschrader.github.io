My name is Brian Schrader. I'm a bioinformatician and software developer, living in San Diego, CA. This site is my little home on the internet; it was built from scratch with TextWrangler and Terminal.

All posts are written in Markdown. If you want to see the original markdown text, just add "article.md" after the "/" in the URL.
