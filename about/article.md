title: About Brian Schrader

<img src=\"http://images.biteofanapple.com/misc/profile-pic.jpg\" class=\"image-right\" style=\"width:40%;\">

My name is Brian Schrader. I'm a self-taught Software Developer, hobbyist writer, and Aerospace Engineering Student living in San Diego, CA. Currently, I'm working as a web developer at the County of San Diego. I've worked on projects ranging from iOS apps, to developing and testing a self-propelling and autonomous glider. This site is my little home on the internet; it was built from scratch using nothing but TextWrangler and Terminal.

All posts are written in Markdown. If you want to see the original markdown text, just add "article.md" after the "/" in the URL.

You can contact me either by email at brian@biteofanapple.com though I tend to be slow at responding to email, or on Twitter where I'm usually pretty active.
