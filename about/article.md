title: About Me
status: draft
template: about.html

Hi, I'm Brian Schrader. I'm an independent software developer, writer, and musician living in San Diego, CA. This site is my little home on the internet where I go on (and on) about things that are important to me.

I own and run [SkyRocket Software][sky], my indie software company, where I make things some people like. I'm a co-founder of [Adventurer's Codex][ac], a tool for enhancing and tracking D&D games. And I'm the singer, song-writer, and guitarist of [The Fourth Section][tfs].

Oh, and I wrote a book about [how to be an Indie Developer](https://goingindie.tech)!

I frequent lots of places on the Internet most of which I've included in the sidebar on the [home page](/) of this site. I [read a lot][read], I [write music][bc], and I [build things][gh]. I've open sourced a [few][cache] [different][b2] [things][variant], and Iâ€™ve built an [HTCPCP-compliant Coffee Pot][coffee]. As you can probably tell, I care deeply about the Web &mdash; and technology more broadly. I care about the future of our discourse on the web, the standards on which itâ€™s based, the changes in society it helps create, how we as people shape it, and how it shapes us in turn.

I occasionally write for several outlets including [a few local papers][bib] and at [Democracy &amp; Progress][dnp]: a blog about San Diego &amp; California policy. In recent years my attention has been focused on local &amp; state policy issues including addressing Homelessness, Housing Affordability &amp; Availability, and Climate Change.

I built this site in 2012 to teach myself programming and I've been blogging here ever since. Since then I've worked in government, medical research, and at a start-up. Technically I learned how to build planes and rockets in school, but I doubt I'd remember any of that now. ðŸš€
