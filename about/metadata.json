I'm a self-taught Software Developer, hobbyist writer, and Aerospace Engineering Student living in San Diego, CA. Currently, I'm working as a web developer at the County of San Diego. I've worked on projects ranging from <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/cl/app/boaa/id650680470?l=en&mt=8\">iOS apps,</a> to developing and testing a <a href=\"https://github.com/Sonictherocketman/Alby-J\">self-propelling and autonomous glider</a>. This site is my little home on the internet; it was built from scratch using nothing but <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/\">TextWrangler</a> and Terminal.</p>\n<h2>Contact Me</h2>\n<p>You can contact me either by email at <a href=\"mailto:brian@biteofanapple.com\">brian@biteofanapple.com</a> though I tend to be slow at responding to email, or on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonicRocketman\">@SonicRocketman</a> where I'm usually pretty active.\n</p>"
