In 2014. This is my little home on the internet, built from scratch using nothing but <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/\">TextWrangler</a> and Terminal.</p><p>All posts are written in Markdown. If you want to see the original markdown text, just add \"article.md\" after the \"/\" in the URL.</p>\n<h2>Contact Me</h2>\n<p>You can contact me either by email at <a href=\"mailto:brian@biteofanapple.com\">brian@biteofanapple.com</a> though I tend to be slow at responding to email, or on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonicRocketman\">@sonicrocketman</a> where I'm usually pretty active.\n</p>"
